# ADM-2018 

Hi everyone,
here you find the homeworks of ADM class 2018 of the MSc in Data Science @ La Sapienza University. 

In particular, for each assignment, you find a sub directory that contains:

- `README.md` that describes the task
- `SUBMIT.md` that gives the submission specifics

____

## Take a look at
- `EVALUATION.md`: how peer evaluation works

____

## Collaborations
According to the policy presented by Aris, we encourage you to ask questions to your colleagues before coming to TAs office hours. As you did for homework 1, __Slack__ is a powerful means to have an answer to your questions, so use it! Remember that partecipate to a debate is always a good way to practise.

## Office hours
TAs will be available every Friday from 15 to 17 at the gazebos of DIAG, via Ariosto 25. During this time Valerio, Tommaso and Cristina will answer to your questions and will make clarifications about parts of the homework that do not sound clear to you.
