This file is intended to gather the most important questions about the class. It happens many times that the same question is asked more than once. This becomes difficult to handle if we receive tens of e-mails asking for the same clarifications. 

According to the organization of the course, we suggest asking questions on Slack, such that everyone can see our answers. At the same time, we understand that it might be difficult to keep track of all the threads in the channel. For this reason, here we are!
