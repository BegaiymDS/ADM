Danish  intertitles	Atlantis   is a 1913 Danish silent film directed by  August Blom   the head of production at the  Nordisk Film  company  and was based upon the 1912 novel by  Gerhart Hauptmann   It starred an international cast headlined by Danish matinée actor  Olaf Fønss  and Austrian opera diva  Ida Orloff   The film was the first Danish multi reeled feature film  The story  which tells the tale of a doctor who travels to the United States in search of a cure for his ailing wife  includes the tragic sinking of an ocean liner after it strikes an object at sea  Released only one year after the sinking of the  RMS  Titanic    the movie drew considerable attention as well as criticism due to similarities to the actual tragedy     The high production costs for  Atlantis  were not equaled by box office returns at that time  However  the film went on to become the most watched film for Nordisk Film and has been hailed by film historian Erik Ulrichsen as a Danish masterpiece and  one of the first modern films     1       Dr  Friedrich von Kammacher   Olaf Fønss    a surgeon  is devastated after his wife develops a brain disorder and is institutionalized  On the advice of his parents  von Kammacher leaves Denmark to gain some respite from his wife s illness  Von Kammacher travels to Berlin  where he meets a young dancer named Ingigerd   Ida Orloff   and the doctor becomes fond of her and very interested in her  However she has a large number of admirers and thus Von Kammacher gives up on her  However  while in Paris he sees an advertisement in the paper that she is going to New York with her father and decides to follow her  Von Kammacher buys a first ticket on the same liner as Ingigered  the  SS Roland      Aboard the ship  von Kammacher learns Ingigerd has a boyfriend with her and thus he backs down  Shortly after  he is called to treat a young Russian girl with seasickness and they nearly get romantically involved but class stops this from happening     Halfway across the sea the  Roland  strikes an unseen object which causes massive flooding and dooms the ship  The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic  Von Kammacher finds Ingigered passed out in her cabin from shock and carries her to a lifeboat  He goes back and searches in vain her father but when he can t find him  von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigereds hand as the lifeboat pulls away  They watch in horror as the  Roland  sinks into the ocean  The liner sinks so rapidly that many of the lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned  By morning  only von Kammacher s lifeboat is still floating  the rest having been swamped by swimmers  and 8 still alive  They are spotted by a  cargo liner  and saved  Ingigerd is devastated when she is told that there are no more survivors and both her father and boyfriend have drowned     Von Kammacher and Ingigerd arrive in New York and she is unable to continue with her career since she is still shocked over the  Roland  disaster  Von Kammacher tries to tell her that he loves her and wants a life with her in New York but she refuses to be tied down by one man  He gives up on her and they go their separate ways after she turns down his offer to live with him in New York  Von Kammacher is impressed by an art gallery and takes an interest in fine art  Through the artistic community  he is introduced to a kind and pleasant sculptor named Eva Burns  and they develop a friendship  A New York doctor  who is a friend of von Kammacher  offers him the use of a mountain cabin  where it is hoped that Friedrich will find some peace and solace  While he is in the mountains  a telegram from Denmark arrives in New York with information that von Kammacher s wife has died  Upon hearing the news  Friedrich falls critically ill  Eva takes it upon herself to tend to him in the mountain cabin  As she nurses him back to health  their relationship blossoms  Happiness returns to Friedrich s life as he realizes Eva will be a good mother for his children     Due to the large number of cast  extras  and locations  and the amount of equipment  Blom took the unusual step of employing two assistant directors for filming    2    The first was Robert Dinesen who later had his own successful career as a director with Nordisk Film in Denmark and Germany  The second assistant was the young  Hungarian  director  Mihály Kertész   who under the name  Michael Curtiz  became one of the most well known Hollywood directors through films such as   Casablanca   and   White Christmas    Curtiz also appeared in  Atlantis  in a small supporting role     For the filming of the shipboard scenes  Nordisk Film chartered the Norwegian steamship  C F  Tietgen  which had been taken out of service that year  However  the  Atlantis  sinking scene used a large scale model and about 500 extras as swimmers  and was filmed in the bay off  Køge   Denmark    3       Blom filmed two endings for the movie—one happy and one tragic  The alternate tragic ending  in which the Doctor dies at the end  was made in particular for the Russian market  It was believed that the Russians had a preference for sad endings    4       Some sources claimed that the sinking ship scenes were inspired by the   Titanic   sinking which had occurred the previous year  However  Blom based his film entirely on  Gerhardt Hauptmann  s 1912 novel   Atlantis   Hauptmann s novel was published in serialized form in the   Berliner Tageblatt   a month before the  Titanic  disaster    5      6    Nevertheless  due to the film’s release only one year after the  Titanic  sinking   Atlantis  became associated with the  Titanic   In Norway  the film was banned because authorities felt it was in poor taste to turn a tragedy into entertainment    3       Because his original story was partly autobiographical  Hauptmann s contract with Nordisk Film required two roles be acted by the actual people who were their inspiration  A letter from Nordisk Film to Fred  A  Talbot of England explained      the part of  Ingigerd  and the armless virtuoso  Arthur Stoss  were played by the very same persons  who where    sic     so to speak  used as models by Gerhart Hauptmann  when he wrote his famous novel  These two artists  Miss Ida Orloff and Mr  C  Unthan  these are their real names   were his traveling companions on the trip across the Atlantic   Orloff had had a romantic relationship with Hauptmann beginning several years earlier when she was a 16 year old cabaret dancer  Reviewers of  Atlantis  criticized the choice of Orloff because  by the time of filming  she was no longer a svelte athletic dancer who could embody the eroticism of the part  Nevertheless  Nordisk Films had been forced to cast her    2       The other required actor was  Carl Herman Unthan   credited as Charles Unthan   a Prussian violinist who had been born without arms and learned to use his feet as hands  He played the role of Arthur Stoss  an armless virtuoso  Although his abilities were impressive  critics of  Atlantis  felt his appearance in the film was simply extraneous and non integral to the story    2       Another notable actor in  Atlantis  was  Torben Meyer  who went on to a long Hollywood career as a comedic character actor  usually playing a thick accented waiter or maitr de  Some film historians have also spotted Danish comedian  Carl Schenstrøm   later the tall half of the Pat and Patachon comedy team  playing a waiter in the film  Although Schenstrøm was employed at Nordisk Film at the time  his participation has not been fully established    7       Distribution of the film in the United States began in 1914 through the Great Northern Film Company  Like many American films of the time   Atlantis  was subject to cuts by  city and state film censorship boards   The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts in two scenes with nude statues where the sex was visible    8        Atlantis  was restored and released on  laserdisc  in 1993 and in  DVD  format in 2005  The restoration was created through a high definition scan of a restored negative and the tinting was recreated using an abbreviated version from The National Film Center in  Japan     9    The restored version also was made with combined subtitles in  Danish  and  English   Extra material on the DVD included the two minute alternative ending originally filmed for  Russian  audiences and the 15 minute surviving fragment of August Blom’s and  Holger Madsen’s  1914 film
