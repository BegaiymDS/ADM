Charlie Chaplin	Mack Sennett	"Charles Chaplin 
 Jess Dandy John T. Dillon Al St. John"	Frank D. Williams	Keystone Studios	Mutual Film	September 24, 1914  ( 1914-09-24 )	16 minutes	United States	Silent film English (Intertitles)	The New Janitor   was the 27th comedy from  Keystone Studios  to feature  Charlie Chaplin   The film is arguably one of his best for the studio  and a precursor to a key  Essanay Studios  short    The Bank    The film also demonstrates the differences that Chaplin had with Keystone comedy in that it is a coherent whole in which the stock characters actually fill some emotional center  Chaplin brings a certain complexity to his janitor  unusual to the comedy factory of  Mack Sennett   The film  which stars among Sennett s bit players  Jess Dandy    Al St  John    John T  Dillon   and  Helen Carruthers   is far more centered and clear in direction  Comedy flows from within the story rather than as a by product of story  After all this is a typical bank robbery storyline     The hero  a janitor played by Chaplin  is fired from work for accidentally knocking his bucket of water out the window and onto his boss  the chief banker  Dandy   Meanwhile  one of the junior managers  Dillon  is being threatened with exposure by his bookie for his unpaid gambling debts  Thus the manager decides to steal from the company  He is caught in the act of raiding the vault by the bank secretary  Carruthers  who rings for help  Chaplin comes to the rescue only to be misjudged by the chief banker as the thief  The secretary fingers the manager and Charlie receives a just reward and a handshake for foiling the robbery     Moving Picture World commented      A ripping good comedy number with Chas  Champman  sic  playing the part of the janitor   He interpolates a lot of his inimitable funny business and the plot is better than usual      Motion Picture News also got Chaplin s surname wrong in its review    The comical Charles Chapman  sic  in a laughable farce that will arouse peals of laughter from any audience
