Zalibra	Charles Chaplin	Mutual Film Corporation	January 22, 1917  ( 1917-01-22 )	19 min USA, Germany 24 min (restored version)	United States	Silent film English  intertitles	Easy Street   is a 1917 short action comedy film starring and directed by  Charlie Chaplin      In a slum area called Easy Street  the police are failing to maintain law and order     The Little Tramp is sleeping rough outside the  Hope Mission  near the streets of a lawless slum  He is inspired at the mission where there is singing and a sermon from the preacher  His religious  awakening  is inspired by a beautiful young woman who pleads for him to join the mission  holding his hand     Spotting a help wanted ad for a job at the police station  the Little Tramp accepts and is assigned the rough and tumble Easy Street as his beat  Upon entering the street he finds a bully roughing up the locals and pilfering their money  The Little Tramp gets on the wrong side of the bully and following a chase the two eventually come to blows culminating in the Little Tramp inventively using a gas lamp to render the bully unconscious     The bully is taken away by the police but manages to escape from the station and returns to Easy Street  After a long chase the Little Tramp manages to knock the bully unconscious by dropping a heavy stove on his head from an upstairs window  On returning to his beat on Easy Street the unruly mob knock the Little Tramp unconscious and drop him into a nearby cellar where he manages to save the aforementioned beautiful young woman from a nasty drug addict after accidentally sitting on the drug addict s needle  Supercharged by the effects of the drug he takes on the mob and heroically defeats them all and as a consequence restores peace and order to Easy Street       By the end of the film  a New Mission is built on Easy Street and the inhabitants flock to it  even including the former bully  now a well dressed respectable  churchgoing citizen     It could have been inspired by the similarly named  East Street market  in the  Walworth  district of London  where Chaplin is believed to have been born   a suggestion made as early as 1928 in the film  The Life Story of Charlie Chaplin  by Harry B  Parkinson   1    and reasserted in David Robinson s introduction to the most recent edition of  My Autobiography   while the famous trousers and boots of Chaplin s trademark tramp costume may have been drawn from the everyday clothes Chaplin saw worn there     A reviewer from Variety wrote   The resultant chaos and several new stunts will be bound to bring the laughter  and the star s display of agility and acrobatics approaches some of the Douglas Fairbanks pranks   Chaplin has always been throwing things in his films  but when he  eases  a cook stove out of the window onto the head of his adversary on the street below  that pleasant little bouquet adds a new act to his repertory   Easy Street certainly has some rough work in it  maybe a bit rougher than the others  but it is the kind of stuff that Chaplin fans love   In fact  few who see Easy Street will fail to be furnished with hearty laughter      In 1932   Amedee Van Beuren  of Van Beuren Studios  purchased Chaplin s Mutual comedies for  10 000 each  added music by  Gene Rodemich  and  Winston Sharples  and sound effects  and re released them through  RKO Radio Pictures   Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release    2
