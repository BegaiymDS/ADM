United States	Silent film English  intertitles	One A M    was a unique  Charlie Chaplin  silent film created for  Mutual Film  in  1916    It was the first film he starred in alone  except for a brief scene of  Albert Austin  playing a cab driver     The film opens with a scene of a wealthy young man  Chaplin  arriving at his house in a taxi late at night after a night of heavy drinking  He struggles with the car door when exiting the car and then in paying the taxi driver   Albert Austin    When he gets to his front door  he thinks that he has forgotten the key and has to enter through the window  While climbing in through the window  he steps into a fishbowl that s placed underneath it and then almost falls down when the carpet underneath him slides  After finding his balance again  he goes through his pockets and realises that the key has been there all the while  He goes back through the window and enters through the front door     Inside the house  the furniture and other inanimate objects become almost insurmountable obstacles for the drunk  He struggles to balance on the sliding carpets and wonders whether he is wearing skates  Falling down  he lands between a tiger rug and a stuffed  Eurasian lynx   which terrify him as he thinks they are real  He goes over to the table and tries to pour himself a drink  but first he accidentally spins the table top around and then does not manage to pour the drinks inside a glass  He then unsuccessfully attempts to light a cigarette  and then tries to head up the stairs to his bedroom  He fails several times in climbing them  a large  cuckoo clock  on the upstairs landing also poses a problem  due to its pendulum s implausibly wide swing  He becomes increasingly creative with his attempts to climb the stairs  for example by using mountain climbing gear     When he finally reaches his bedroom  he struggles to open his  Murphy bed  and ends up wrecking it  He gives up on the idea of sleeping in his bed and goes to bathroom  He enters the shower and accidentally turns it on  Soaked  he then gets into the bathtub and falls asleep under a towel     A reviewer for the Louisville Herald wrote   Charlie  by himself  creates all the action that is necessary to produce the laughs for which he has become noted  and there is no doubt that this is the most exacting role the comedian has ever essayed      Although the film s title suggests the action is supposed to occur at about one a m   when Charlie arrives home in the taxi cab  it is quite bright outside  This is presumably due to the impracticality of night shooting at the time      Edna Purviance  s absence from the cast was a rarity   Apart from Chaplin s first film after leaving Keystone Studios    His New Job   One A M  was the only Chaplin film from 1915 to 1923 not to feature Purviance in some role     In 1932   Amedee Van Beuren  of Van Beuren Studios  purchased Chaplin s Mutual comedies for  10 000 each  added music by  Gene Rodemich  and  Winston Sharples  and sound effects  and re released them through  RKO Radio Pictures   Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release    1
