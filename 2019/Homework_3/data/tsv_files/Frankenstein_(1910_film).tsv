Searle Dawley	Frankenstein  by  Mary Shelley	Augustus Phillips  Charles Ogle  Mary Fuller	Edison Manufacturing Company	Edison Manufacturing Company	March 18, 1910  ( 1910-03-18 )	14 minutes (975 feet)	United States	Silent with English  intertitles	Frankenstein   is a 1910 film made by  Edison Studios   It was written and directed by  J  Searle Dawley     1       This 14 minute short film was the first motion picture adaptation of  Mary Shelley  s   Frankenstein    The unbilled cast included  Augustus Phillips  as  Dr  Frankenstein    Charles Ogle  as  Frankenstein s monster   and  Mary Fuller  as the doctor s  fiancée     2       Described as  a liberal adaptation of Mrs  Shelley s famous story   the plot description in the  Edison Kinetogram  was    3       Frankenstein  a young student  is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye  as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences  Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else  His great ambition is to create a human being  and finally one night his dream is realized  He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen  We see his experiment commence and the development of it  The formation of the hideous monster from the blazing chemicals of a huge cauldron in Frankenstein s laboratory is probably the most weird  mystifying and fascinating scene ever shown on a film  To Frankenstein s horror  instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace  there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful  ghastly  abhorrent monster  As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room  only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed  He falls fainting to the floor  where he is found by his servant  who revives him     After a few weeks  illness  he returns home  a broken  weary man  but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life  In other words  the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts  His marriage is soon to take place  But one evening  while sitting in his library  he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room  All the terror of the past comes over him and  fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth  he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart  who then comes in  to stay only a moment  Then follows a strong  dramatic scene  The monster  who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog  is insanely jealous of anyone else  He snatches from Frankenstein s coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him  and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor  here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror  Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room  Not being able  however  to live apart from his creator  he again comes to the house on the wedding night and  searching for the cause of his jealousy  goes into the bride s room  Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror  which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet  The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein s feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house     Here comes the point which we have endeavored to bring out  namely  That when Frankenstein s love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist  This theory is clearly demonstrated in the next and closing scene  which has probably never been surpassed in anything shown on the moving picture screen  The monster  broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator  enters the room  stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly  Gradually  the real monster fades away  leaving only the image in the mirror  A moment later Frankenstein himself enters  As he stands directly before the mirror we are amazed to see the image of the monster reflected instead of Frankenstein s own  Gradually  however  under the effect of love and his better nature  the monster s image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror  His bride joins him  and the film ends with their embrace  Frankenstein s mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long       Dawley  working for the Edison Company  shot the film in three to four days at the Edison Studios in the  Bronx    New York City     4    The production was deliberately designed to de emphasize the horrific aspects of the story and focus on the story s mystical and psychological elements    5        In making the film the Edison Co  has carefully tried to eliminate all actual repulsive situations and to concentrate its endeavors upon the mystic and psychological problems that are to be found in this weird tale  Whenever  therefore  the film differs from the original story it is purely with the idea of elimination of what would be repulsive to a moving picture audience    6        Frankenstein  was among the earlier silent films to have an associated  cue sheet   providing suggested musical accompaniment    7    From the cue sheet    8      9       At opening   Andante —

Laurie    and the Bridal Chorus from the 1850 opera   Lohengrin      10       The film  just as all other  motion pictures  released before 1924  is now in the  public domain  in the   United States      For many years  it was believed a  lost film   In 1963  a plot description and stills  below  were discovered published from the March 15  1910 issue of the film catalog   The Edison Kinetogram     11       In the early 1950s  a print of this film was purchased by a  Wisconsin  film collector  Alois F  Dettlaff  from his mother in law  who also collected films    12    He did not realize its rarity until many years later  Its existence was first revealed in the mid 1970s  Although somewhat deteriorated  the film was in viewable condition  complete with titles and  tints  as seen in 1910  Dettlaff had a 35 mm preservation copy made in the late 1970s  He also issued a  DVD  release of 1 000 copies    13       BearManor Media released the  public domain  film in a restored edition on March 18  2010 alongside the novel   Edison s Frankenstein   which was written by Frederick C  Wiebel  Jr    14       In 2016  the  film society  of the  University of Geneva  undertook their own restoration of the film  with image restoration by Julien Dumoulin and an original soundtrack by Nicolas Hafner    15    performed on a Wurlitzer  theatre organ  located at College Claparède    16    The restored version of the film was shown on 10 October 2016    17       On November 15  2018  in recognition of Mary Shelly s bicentennial  the  Library of Congress  announced via a blog post that they had completed a full restoration of the short film  having purchased the Dettlaff collection in 2014  The restoration was made available to the general public for streaming and downloading via their  YouTube  channel and online National Screening Room  as well as in the blog post announcing the restoration s completion    18
