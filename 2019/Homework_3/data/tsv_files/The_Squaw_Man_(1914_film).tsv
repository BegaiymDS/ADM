for the film   Farnum was a notable Broadway star and his wife in real life  Winifred Kingston  was also a well known actress  She played the English love interest    1     Red Wing   real name Lillian St  Cyr  was born into the  Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska  on the  Winnebago Reservation   and she played the American Indian wife    2       Directed by  Oscar Apfel  and  Cecil B  DeMille  and  produced  by DeMille and  Jesse L  Lasky   the  screenplay  was  adapted  by  Beulah Marie Dix  from the 1905 stage play   of the same name   written by  Edwin Milton Royle      This first screen version of the story was the legendary DeMille s first movie assignment  It was also one of the first  feature length  Westerns filmed specifically in  Hollywood   DeMille wanted to emphasize the outdoors and wanted to shoot the movie in exotic scenery and great vistas  Initially he traveled to  Flagstaff  Arizona  to film the movie  After seeing the vast amount of mountains near Flagstaff  the production was moved to Los Angeles  It was not the first film to be made in the  Los Angeles  area  and film historians agree that  shorts  had previously been filmed in Hollywood  with   In Old California   considered the earliest  Harbor scenes were shot in  San Pedro  California  and the western saloon set was built beside railroad tracks in the  San Fernando Valley   Footage of cattle on the open range was shot at Keen Camp near  Idyllwild  California   while snow scenes were shot at  Mount Palomar     3    Cecil B  DeMille felt that lighting in a movie was extremely important and viewed it as the visual and emotional foundation to build his image  He believed that lighting was to a film as “music is to an opera”    1        The Squaw Man  went on to become the only movie successfully filmed three times by the same director producer  DeMille  He filmed a  silent remake  in  1918   and a  talkie   version  in  1931    The Squaw Man  was 74 minutes long and generated  244 700 in profit    1      3       Non Native American actor Joseph Singleton played the role of Tabywana  Nat U Ritch s father  Lillian St  Cyr of the  Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska  was cast to play the role of Nat U Ritch  a member of the Ute tribe  She is also known as  Princess Redwing    St  Cyr along with her husband  James Young Deer   of the  Nanticoke people  of Delaware    4    have been regarded one of the first  Native American power couple  in Hollywood along with  Mona Darkfeather  and her husband director Frank E  Montgomery    5    DeMille had selected Lillian St  Cyr but his first choice had been  Mona Darkfeather  who was not available    3       During the early silent film era  films based on Native Americans were popular  The central theme of this film was miscegenation  In the state of California  anti miscegenation laws existed until 1948  however  while African Americans couldn t legally marry whites in California during filming  marriages between Native Americans and whites were permitted  Though there were Native American actors  whites were mostly cast as Indian characters    6       During the early teens  Young Deer and his wife Lillian St  Cyr helped to transform how Native American characters were represented  The characters they created were sympathetic in complex ways  although other studios like Kalem were also attempting to accurately portray Natives in film    6    However  other scholars argue that Native American themed silent films did not alter in any way the dominant perception of Indians themselves  Apparently  many films displayed the Native American experience from many different perspectives and did involve Native American writers  filmmakers  and actors during this time period
