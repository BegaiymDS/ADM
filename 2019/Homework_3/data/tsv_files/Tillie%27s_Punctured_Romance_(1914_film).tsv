intertitles	Tillie s Punctured Romance   is a 1914 American  silent   comedy film  directed by  Mack Sennett  and starring   Marie Dressler    Mabel Normand    Charlie Chaplin   and the  Keystone Kops   The picture was the first feature length motion picture produced by the  Keystone Film Company   and is the only one featuring Chaplin     The film is based on Dressler s stage play  Tillie s Nightmare  by  A  Baldwin Sloane  and   Edgar Smith    Tillie s Punctured Romance  is notable for being the last Chaplin film which he neither wrote nor directed  as well as the first feature length comedy in  all of cinema   In it  Chaplin plays an entirely different role from his  Tramp  character  which was relatively new at the time      Charles Chaplin  portrays a  womanizing  city man who meets Tillie   Marie Dressler   in the country after a fight with his girlfriend   Mabel Normand    When he sees that Tillie s father   Mack Swain   has a very large bankroll for his workers  he persuades her to  elope  with him  In the city  he meets the woman he was seeing already  and tries to work around the complication to steal Tillie s money  He gets Tillie drunk in a restaurant and asks her to let him hold the pocketbook  Since she is drunk  she agrees  and he escapes with his old girlfriend and the money     Later that day  they see a picture show entitled  A Thief s Fate   which illustrates their thievery in the form of a  morality play   They both feel guilty and leave the theater  While sitting on a park bench  a paperboy   Gordon Griffith   asks him to buy a  newspaper   He does so  and reads the story about Tillie s Uncle Banks   Charles Bennett    a millionaire who died while on a mountain climbing expedition  Tillie is named sole heir and inherits three million dollars  The man leaves his girlfriend on the park bench and runs to the restaurant  where Tillie is now forced to work to support herself as she is too embarrassed to go home  He begs her to take him back and although she is skeptical at first  she believes that he truly loves her and they marry  They move into the uncle s  mansion  and throw a big party  which ends horribly when Tillie finds her husband with his old girlfriend  smuggled into the house and working as one of their maids     The uncle is found on a mountaintop  alive after all  He goes back to his mansion  in disarray after Tillie instigated a gunfight  a direct result of the husband smuggling the old girlfriend into the house  which  luckily  did not harm anyone  Uncle Banks insists that Tillie be arrested for the damage she has caused to his house  The three run from the cops all the way to a dock  where a car  bumps  Tillie into the water  She flails about  hoping to be rescued  She is eventually pulled to safety  and both Tillie and the man s girlfriend realize that they are too good for him  He leaves  and the two girls become friends        2       The film  which costs roughly  50 000   1 2 million in 2015  to make  was based on the Broadway play  Tillie s Nightmare     3    which Dressler had great success in  on Broadway  and on tour in the United States  from 1910 to 1912    4    Dressler would revive the play with her own touring company     Although he wears a mustache  Chaplin s characterization in this movie is distinctly different from that of his beloved   Little Tramp    Although it is usually assumed that his performance in this film predated his crafting of the Tramp persona  Chaplin had already appeared in more than 30 shorts as the Tramp by the time  Tillie s Punctured Romance  was released     The comedy in the film is largely  slapstick   people frequently kick each other or trip each other  four men unsuccessfully attempt to help Tillie up when she falls  Tillie  taken to the police station  has a police officer wave his finger in her face  and she bites it      Milton Berle  always claimed that he played the five year old paperboy in the film    5    but the role was actually portrayed by  Gordon Griffith      This is one of only two films  the other is   Making a Living    another pre Tramp film  in which both Chaplin and the  Keystone Cops  appear     Following its December 21  1914 premiere at the Los Angeles Republic Theatre    6    the film was a tremendous success    7    As the  Mutual Film Corporation   distributors of all Keystone s shorts  was not equipped to handle features   Tillie  became Chaplin s only Keystone to be distributed by the newly formed Alco Film Corporation  It remained in theatrical release for years  being continually re edited and shortened  and much later having optical soundtracks added featuring music  sound effects and narration     For decades the film was only available in poor quality  truncated prints  but eventually  David Shepard  of Film Preservation Associates released his restoration on LaserDisc  1997  and DVD  1999  via  Image Entertainment   It was coupled with   Mabel s Married Life    1914   another Keystone film featuring Normand  Chaplin and Swain  In 2003 a second restoration  a collaboration between  UCLA Film and Television Archive  and the  British Film Institute   used more complete  higher quality materials and saw  Tillie  returned almost to its original length  This version has been released in the fully restored  Chaplin at Keystone  4 DVD box set  2010  by various labels worldwide    8       Dressler appeared as Tillie in three more movies    Tillie s Tomato Surprise    1915     Tillie Wakes Up    1917   and   The Scrub Lady    1917   aka  Tillie the Scrub Lady   In  Tillie Wakes Up   the Tillie character has a different last name  which could be explained by the fact that her character is married     Another comedy called   Tillie s Punctured Romance   was released in 1928 starring  W  C  Fields  as a circus ringmaster  Although often erroneously cited as a  remake   the later movie actually bears no resemblance to the 1914 film aside from the shared title   Chester Conklin  and  Mack Swain  appear in both movies  however     In   The Simpsons   episode   American History X cellent    one of  Mr  Burns   belongings includes a ticket stub for  Tillie s Punctured Romance
