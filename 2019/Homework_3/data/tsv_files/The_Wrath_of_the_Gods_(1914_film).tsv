Reginald Barker  and starring  Sessue Hayakawa    Tsuru Aoki    Frank Borzage    Thomas Kurihara  and  Henry Kotani   This was the first feature film appearance of Hayakawa and the directorial debut of Barker     The film is based on an American sailor who comes to the Yamaki family after his ship wrecks in the ocean  The sailor  Borzage  falls in love with the daughter  Aoki  of the family  unaware of the fact that she is cursed by God  such that if she marries  a nearby volcano will erupt and destroy the entire island on which the family lives  Writer and producer  Thomas H  Ince  got the idea for the film from the volcanic eruption on the island of  Sakura Jima  in 1914  Hayakawa was paid  500 a week  the highest paid of all oriental stars at the time     Filming started on January 27  1914 and was completed on February 13  The film was released to a warm reception on June 7 after a large scale publicity campaign  The visual effects of the film were widely appreciated by critics  It premiered in Japan on 15 September 1918  where it was later banned for  bringing dishonor to the country   Hayakawa  who played Aoki s father in the film  married her before the film s premiere     Baron Yamaki   Sessue Hayakawa   is a fisherman who lives along with his daughter Toya San   Tsuru Aoki   on an island  The island is inhabited by  Buddhists  and Yamaki had been cursed by  Buddha  for an affront by one of his ancestors who in a murderous rage  defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple  The curse was that if his daughter married anyone  then the nearby volcano would erupt  Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo   Thomas Kurihara   has spread the rumour that she is cursed  She is therefore unwilling to continue her father s acceptance of the curse  When Yamaki takes Toya san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house to pray and try to get the curse removed  she vents her feelings about the god s unfairness     An American sailor  Tom Wilson   Frank Borzage    whose ship has been wrecked in a storm comes to them for help and shelter  Wilson falls in love with Toya and teaches her about  Christianity   To the consternation of her father  Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese American mission  However  her father also converts  The locals  who have been stirred up by Takeo  go on a murderous rampage against the family  They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they go to the beach house instead  When the mob reaches his house  Yamaki throws out the  Buddha statue  he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place  The villagers are infuriated by this  they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house  Eventually  the volcano erupts and the village is destroyed  and Takeo dies in an  avalanche   Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive  They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel  At the end of the film  Tom tells his bride   Your gods may be powerful  Toya San  but mine has proved his omnipotence  You are saved to perpetuate your race      On 12 January 1914  a volcano erupted on the island of  Sakura Jima  in  Kagoshima  prefecture  in the southern part of  Japan   It was one of the biggest disasters in the history of Japan  Producer  Thomas H  Ince  immediately decided to make a film based on the incident  The   Toledo Blade   reported on 24 January 1914 that  News of the eruption was hardly a day old before Mr  Ince had built in Santa Monica canyon a whole Japanese village     1    Ince had constructed a very large village in his studio  Inceville  in  Culver City  California   and decided  where possible  to use Japanese people instead of Americans as extras  He gathered workers from the  Southern California  who were to work as peasants in the film    1      2    Approximately 1 000  mostly Japanese  extras were used  The film s shooting began on 27 January 1914  just 15 days after the eruption ceased  Actress  Enid Markey  was  badly injured  during the production  during her scene in which the lava flow destroys the village she was surrounded by smoke and fumes and nearly asphyxiated  but had recovered by May 1914    3      4    Six reels were used to film it in total    5      6       To help publicize the production  Ince reported to the newspapers that lead actress Tsuru Aoki was a native of the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption—she was actually from  Obara Tsuru  city   Kyushu   180 miles north of Sakura Jima    1      7    Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to the middle class audiences as the heroine of a melodrama  claiming that she was the daughter of an illustrious Japanese artist    1    The biographical type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film    7       Sessue Hayakawa  Aoki s soon to be husband  played her father in the film  they married on May 1 just before the film s release    7      8    Hayakawa was paid  500 a week and  seeing another chance to publicize his production  Ince stated that Hayakawa was  the highest paid of all oriental stars     9    The film s shipwreck scene was shot off the coast of  Santa Monica     9    and an erupting volcano was also included among its lavish effects    9    This was the first feature film appearance of Hayakawa   10      9    and the directorial debut of Barker     Targeted at the middle class  a large scale publicity campaign was organized by the New York Motion Picture Corporation    11    Four months prior to the release  New York Motion Picture Corporation put an advertisement in the 14 February 1914 edition of the   New York Clipper    announcing   Wait for The Wrath of the Gods   Major journals carried full page advertisements of the film every week with pictures  various ad lines and photographs taken on the film set    11    An advertisement of the film featured an angry looking statue of Buddha and a young woman in a kimono praying in front of it  The marriage of the lead actors Tsuru Aoki and Sessue Hayakawa was also included in the publicity campaign  The film was released in a new theater called The Strand  on 7 June 1914    12         Variety   noted that  special and incidental music was written by Joseph Littau  pianist of the orchestra there  The stage  at the Strand  was given a Japanesy air and atmosphere by the management     13     The Wrath of the Gods  was purported to have attracted 21 000 spectators when  Marcus Loew  screened it along with a vaudeville bill at the opening of his summertime evening entertainment at  Ebbets Field  in  Brooklyn     14       The film was well received by critics  particularly for its visual effects  especially the volcano eruption scene    15    An advertisement for the film in the   Williamsport Sun Gazette   stated  Nothing like the  Wrath of God  has ever been seen  Pandemonium  Thrilling  Superb     16    The  Reading Times  called the film a  genuine masterpiece   stating that it contained  the greatest volcano scenes ever filmed  at the time    17    The New York Critics also hailed the film as a masterpiece    18    and the   Brooklyn Daily Eagle   considered it to be the best film of 1914    19      The Washington Post   wrote that the  scenic effects obtained are especially picturesque  a volcano in full action becoming the central sensation     20    The   Chicago Daily Tribune   called the film  impressive   and spoke of the  scenic splendor  and the  vigorous beauty of the outdoor settings     21     True Republican  wrote that  In the motion picture field  the film  was greater than  The Darling of the Gods  in drama  or  Madame Butterfly  in opera   It also wrote that the volcanic eruption and typhoon scenes  can never be obliterated from the mind     22       The film was praised for its happy ending even though the Aoki s character lost her village    23    Critic Gina Marchetti proposed in her book  Tragic and Transcendent Love in the Forbidden City  that the film was  simultaneously warning against miscegenation while celebrating romantic love     24    The lead actress Tsuru Aoki s acting was also highly appreciated for adding  the sense of naturalness to the archetypal narrative between Japan and the United States     7    However  in Japan the lead actors Hayakawa and Aoki were considered insults to the country  The Japanese film critics labeled the film  Anti Japanese  for portraying the country and its people in a primitive manner  The film premiered in Asakusa s Fujikan Theater on September 15  1918 but was banned a few weeks later for bringing  dishonour to the country     25      26      27       The father Yamaki sacrifices himself in order to cut all ties between her daughter and Japan hoping that she would be protected by Tom and his Christian God    28     While referring to the film in particular  the film theorist Kaeriyama Norimasa said  Isn t it a huge loss that Japanese producers don t make any film for export and have all the greatly unique landscape of Japan by foreigners     29     Daisuke Miyao   in   The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema    states that the film and its narrative of a religion collision  emphasize the difficulty for a Japanese woman to become submissive to Christianity and the American family system   stating that the film is first and foremost  an archetypal fable pitting the civilized West  embodied by an American sailor  against the primitive East  embodied by the Japanese woman  told as a religious battle between Buddhism and Christianity     30       The film was screened along with   The Dragon Painter    which also stars Sessue Hayakawa  at the 30th  Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival  on May 4  2014    31    The film s DVD was released in the United States on 18 March 2008
