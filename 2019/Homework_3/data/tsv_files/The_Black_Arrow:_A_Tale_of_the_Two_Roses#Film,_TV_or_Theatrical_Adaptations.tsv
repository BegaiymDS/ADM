The Black Arrow  A Tale of the Two Roses   is an 1888 novel by  Robert Louis Stevenson   It is both an historical  adventure novel  and a  romance novel   It first appeared as a  serial  in 1883 with the subtitle  A Tale of Tunstall Forest  beginning in   Young Folks  A Boys  and Girls  Paper of Instructive and Entertaining Literature    vol  XXII  no  656  Saturday  30 June 1883    1    and ending in the issue for Saturday  20 October 1883   2   —Stevenson had finished writing it by the end of summer    3    It was printed under the pseudonym Captain George North    4    He alludes to the time gap between the serialisation and the publication as one volume in 1888 in his preface  Critic  parodying  Dickens s    Cricket    on the Hearth    The tale was written years ago for a particular audience       5    The  Paston Letters  were Stevenson s main literary source for  The Black Arrow     6        The Black Arrow  tells the story of Richard  Dick  Shelton during the  Wars of the Roses   how he becomes a knight  rescues his lady Joanna Sedley  and obtains justice for the murder of his father  Sir Harry Shelton  Outlaws in Tunstall Forest organised by Ellis Duckworth  whose weapon and calling card is a black arrow  cause Dick to suspect that his guardian Sir Daniel Brackley and his retainers are responsible for his father s murder  Dick s suspicions are enough to turn Sir Daniel against him  so he has no recourse but to escape from Sir Daniel and join the outlaws of the Black Arrow against him  This struggle sweeps him up into the greater conflict surrounding them all     The novel is set in the reign of  old  King Henry VI    1422–1461  1470–1471  and during the  Wars of the Roses   1455–1487   The story begins with the Tunstall Moat House alarm bell  rung to summon recruits for its absent lord Sir Daniel Brackley  to join the Battle of Risingham  at which the outlaw  fellowship  known as  the Black Arrow  begins to strike with its  four black arrows  for the  four black hearts  of Brackley and three of his retainers  Nicholas Appleyard  Bennet Hatch  and Sir Oliver Oates  the parson  The rhyme posted in explanation of this attack  makes the  protagonist  Richard   Dick   Shelton  ward of Sir Daniel  curious about the death of his father Sir Harry Shelton  Having been dispatched to Kettley  where Sir Daniel was quartered  and sent to Tunstall Moat House by return dispatch  he falls in with a fugitive  Joanna Sedley  disguised as a boy with the alias of John Matcham  an heiress kidnapped by Sir Daniel to obtain guardianship over her and to retain his control over Richard by marrying her to him     As they travel through Tunstall Forest  Joanna tries to persuade Dick to turn against Sir Daniel in sympathy with the Black Arrow outlaws  whose camp they discover near the ruins of Grimstone manor  The next day they are met in the forest by Sir Daniel himself  disguised as a leper and returning to the Moat House after his side was defeated at Risingham  Dick and Joanna then follow Sir Daniel to the Moat House  Here Dick confirms that Sir Daniel is the murderer of his father  and escapes injured from the Moat House  He is rescued by the outlaws of the Black Arrow     The second half of the novel  Books 3–5  tells how Dick rescues Joanna from Sir Daniel with the help of both the Black Arrow fellowship and the Yorkist army led by Richard Crookback  the future  Richard III of England   It centres on Shoreby  where the Lancastrian forces are entrenched  Robert Louis Stevenson inserts seafaring adventure in chapters 4–6 of Book 3  wherein Dick and the outlaws steal a ship and attempt a seaside rescue of Joanna  They are unsuccessful  and after Joanna is moved to Sir Daniel s main quarters in Shoreby  Dick visits her in the guise of a Franciscan friar  Stevenson  the populariser of the tales of the Arabian nights  has Dick tell the tale of  Ali Baba  and the Forty Thieves in Book 4  chapter 6 to help him escape from the ruined sea captain Arblaster  whose ship Dick and the outlaws had stolen     While shadowing Sir Daniel  Dick and the outlaws encounter another group of spies interested in Joanna  After a skirmish in which the outlaws prevail  Dick finds that he has conquered Joanna s lawful guardian  Lord Foxham  who promises to give Joanna to Dick in marriage after a contemplated seaside rescue  There is irony in Foxham scolding Dick  who is nobly born  for consorting with outlaws when the outlaws are recruited in Dick and Foxham s plans to rescue Joanna  Wounded in the failed seaside rescue  Foxham writes letters of recommendation for Dick to Richard Crookback  whom Dick must find on the outskirts of Shoreby     Richard Crookback  Duke of Gloucester  makes his appearance in Book 5  As Dick is leaving Shoreby he sees Crookback holding his own against seven or eight Lancastrian assailants  and assists his victory  Dick s accurate knowledge of the Lancastrian forces in Shoreby aid Crookback in winning the battle that he wages later that day  Dick is also successful as one of Crookback s commanders  Crookback knights Dick on the field of battle and  following their victory  gives him fifty horsemen to pursue Sir Daniel  who has escaped Shoreby with Joanna  Dick succeeds in rescuing Joanna  but loses his men in the process  He  Joanna  and Alicia Risingham travel to Holywood where he and Joanna are married  In this way he keeps his initial pledge to Joanna to convey her safely to Holywood     In the early morning of his wedding day Dick encounters a fugitive Sir Daniel trying to enter Holywood seaport to escape to France or  Burgundy   Because it is his wedding day  Dick does not want to soil his hands with Sir Daniel s blood  so he simply bars his way by challenging him either to hand to hand combat or alerting a Yorkist perimeter patrol  Sir Daniel retreats  but is shot by Ellis Duckworth  the outlaws  captain  with the last black arrow  Thereafter Sir Richard and Lady Shelton live in Tunstall Moat House untroubled by the rest of the Wars of the Roses  They provide for both Captain Arblaster and the outlaw Will Lawless by pensioning them and settling them in Tunstall hamlet  where Lawless does a  volte face  by returning to the  Franciscan  order  taking the name  Brother Honestus      From the information given in the novel two time references for the two blocks of action that constitute the narrative can be pinpointed  May 1460   26    and January 1461    27    The important time indicator is the  Battle of Wakefield   30 December 1460  which Stevenson describes in the first chapter of Book 3    mw parser output  templatequote overflow hidden margin 1em 0 padding 0 40px  mw parser output  templatequote

been eventful for England  The party of Lancaster  which was then in the very article of death  had once more raised its head  The Yorkists defeated and dispersed  their leader butchered on the field  it seemed  – for a very brief season in the winter following upon the events already recorded  as if the House of Lancaster had finally triumphed over its foes    28        It is because Richard Crookback  later  Richard III of England   is presented as an adult active in the Wars of the Roses in January 1461 that Stevenson provides the footnote   At the date of this story  Richard Crookback could not have been created  Duke of Gloucester   but for clearness  with the reader s leave  he shall so be called     29    Richard was born in 1452  so he would have been merely 8 years old at the time of this story  A later footnote emphasises this again   Richard Crookback would have been really far younger at this date  i e  January  1461      30    Stevenson follows  William Shakespeare  in retrojecting Richard of Gloucester into an earlier period of the  Wars of the Roses  and portraying him as a dour  hunchback —Stevenson   the formidable hunchback     31     See  Henry VI  part 2    Henry VI  part 3   and  Richard III    This characterisation closely follows the  Tudor myth   a tradition that overly vilified  Richard of Gloucester  and cast the entire English Fifteenth century as a bloody  barbaric chaos in contrast to the  Tudor  era of law and order     Curiously  the 1948 film  The Black Arrow  portrays Richard of Gloucester in a more favourable light than in the novel  somewhat anticipating the work of Paul Murray Kendall to rehabilitate him  Kendall   Richard III   1956   When Richard is told he is  more than kind   he replies jokingly that such rumours would ruin his  bad   reputation   the revision of the  Tudor myth       Stevenson liked his characterisation of Richard Crookback  and expressed his desire to write about him again  Stevenson alludes both to his novel  The Black Arrow  and Richard Crookback with the phrase  the Sable Missile  in a letter he wrote  Sidney Colvin  in the month the final instalment of  The Black Arrow  appeared in  Young Folks   October 1883       Your remarks on  The Black Arrow  are to the point  I am pleased you liked Crookback  he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always fired my attention  I wish Shakespeare had written the play after he had learned some of the rudiments of literature and art rather than before  Some day  I will re tickle the Sable Missile  and shoot it   moyennant finances   tr   for a  financial  consideration    once more into the air  I can lighten it of much  and devote some more attention to Dick o  Gloucester  It s great sport to write tushery    32       The Battle of Shoreby  a fictitious battle that is the main event of Book 5  is modelled after the  First Battle of St Albans  in the  Wars of the Roses     33    This battle in history as in the novel was a victory for the House of York  The presence of an abbey church in Shoreby is reminiscent of the abbey church of  Tewkesbury  to which the Lancastrians fled for  sanctuary  after the  battle  on 4 May 1471     In the  prologue  Stevenson intimates that the Tunstall of  The Black Arrow  is a real place   Tunstall hamlet at that period  in the reign of old King Henry VI    wore much the same appearance as it wears today      34    In south east  Suffolk   England  18 miles NE of  Ipswich   less than 10 miles from the  North Sea  a  Tunstall  is located with an accompanying forest  Stevenson and his family had visited Suffolk in 1873    35    The similarity of place names near this  Tunstall  Suffolk  to place names in the novel also suggest that this is Stevenson s Tunstall  Kettley  Risingham and Foxham are probably  Kettleburgh    Framlingham  and  Farnham  in actuality  The identities of Shoreby on the Till and Holywood are probably  Orford  and  Leiston  respectively    36    Orford is on the North Sea and is joined to Framlingham by a road going to the northwest  the  highroad from Risingham to Shoreby      37    and Leiston is also on the North Sea with  a medieval abbey  like Holywood of the novel  The River Till  which figures largely in Book 1 of the novel  would then be the River Deben in actuality  The River Deben flows near Kettleburgh     The name of the main character Richard Shelton and his inheritance  Tunstall  were the name and title of an actual historical personage  Sir Richard Tunstall  He  as a  Lancastrian  and ardent supporter of King  Henry VI of England   held  Harlech Castle  against the  Yorkists  from 1465 to 1468 during the first part of  Edward IV s  reign  In contrast  Richard Shelton  who becomes the  knight  of Tunstall at the end of  The Black Arrow   is a staunch Yorkist     Two other anachronisms in the novel are Sir Oliver and others speaking of  Simnel  and  the Walsinghams  as suspected organizers of the Black Arrow fellowship   Lambert Simnel  was the focus of rebellion in  Henry VII s  reign  1485–1509   and  the Walsinghams   Stevenson s renaming of the Woodvilles  would have played a part only after May 1464  when  Edward IV  married  Elizabeth Woodville       The Black Arrow  consists of 79 926 words  so it can be classified a novel rather than a novella   novelette   short story  or  flash fiction       Stevenson himself was the first critic of his  Black Arrow   referring to it as  tushery  with reference to his use of archaic English dialogue  In a May 1883 letter to H E  Henley Stevenson wrote      The influenza has busted me a good deal  I have no spring  and am headachy  So  as my good Red Lion Counter begged me for another Butcher s Boy I turned me to what thinkest  ou  to Tushery  by the mass  Ay  friend  a whole tale of tushery  And every tusher tushes me so free  that may I be tushed if the whole thing is worth a tush   The Black Arrow  A Tale of Tunstall Forest  is his name  tush  a poor thing    32        His wife Fanny was anonymously acknowledged in the  fly leaf  as the  critic on the hearth    38   —this offers an explanation for this critic and the author having  joint lives  and being on the  hearth   emblematic of home  For the planned fourteen volume  Edinburgh  edition of his works  Stevenson indicated that he did not want to write an introduction to  The Black Arrow —his wife Fanny  however  did so for the 1905 Biographical Edition of his works   The Black Arrow  is in good company as Stevenson also did not like his   Strange Case of Dr  Jekyll and Mr  Hyde       Praise for  The Black Arrow  is rare among literary critics over its 125 year history  though the novelist  John Galsworthy  wrote that it was  a livelier picture of medieval times than I remember elsewhere in fiction     39    The reason for this stems from Stevenson s own dislike of  The Black Arrow  coupled with a misunderstanding of his attitude toward what he called  tushery     40       On 18 December 2007  Penguin Books  issued an historic first annotated edition of  The Black Arrow  with the introduction and notes by  Professor John A  Sutherland   Emeritus Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London and visiting professor of literature at the California Institute of Technology    41    Professor Sutherland makes mention of this Wikipedia article in this edition    42    The book cover depicts two fifteenth century warriors battling with red and white roses for the two houses of Lancaster and York respectively  It can be noted that the white rose of the cover is larger than the red rose denoting the ascendancy of the House of York at the conclusion of the narrative  The illustration provides a symbolic representation of the title of the novel    43        The Black Arrow  has been adapted for film and television several times  often very loosely  Adaptations include the following     The Robert Louis Stevenson website maintains a complete list of derivative works    44       In October 1946 The Gilberton Company of New York published their   Classics Illustrated    comic book  version of  The Black Arrow  as  No  31     45       In 1964  Editorial Sea Novaro  Mexico  published a comic adaptation in Tesoro De Cuentes Clasicos  89   La Flecha Negra     46       Half of Stevenson s original manuscripts are lost  including those of   Treasure Island     The Black Arrow  and   The Master of Ballantrae    Stevenson s heirs sold Stevenson s papers during World War I  many Stevenson documents were auctioned off in 1918    47
