short   The film stars  Charlie Chaplin  s  Tramp  character as an  immigrant  coming to the  United States  who is accused of theft on the voyage across the  Atlantic Ocean   and falls in love with a beautiful young woman along the way   It also stars  Edna Purviance  and  Eric Campbell      The movie was written and directed by Chaplin     According to Kevin Brownlow and David Gill s documentary series   Unknown Chaplin    the first scenes to be written and filmed take place in what became the movie s second half  in which the penniless Tramp finds a coin and goes for a meal in a restaurant  not realising that the coin has fallen out of his pocket  It was not until later that Chaplin decided the reason the Tramp was penniless was that he had just arrived on a boat from  Europe   and used this notion as the basis for the first half  Purviance reportedly was required to eat so many plates of beans during the many takes to complete the restaurant sequence  in character as another immigrant who falls in love with Charlie  that she became physically ill     The scene in which Chaplin s character kicks an immigration officer was cited later as evidence of his anti Americanism when he was forced to leave the  United States  in 1952   In 1998   The Immigrant  was selected for preservation in the  United States   National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant     1       The film begins aboard a steamship crossing the  Atlantic Ocean   and initially showcases the misadventures of an unnamed immigrant  the Little Tramp  Chaplin  who finds himself in assorted mischief  The scene opens with Charlie bent double over the side of the ship  appearing to be seasick  Then it is revealed he is only fishing     Much humour is derived from the heavy sway of the boat  with much sliding around the deck     Charlie  among other things  plays cards  eats in the mess hall  and avoids seasick passengers  Along the way  he befriends another unnamed immigrant  Purviance  who is traveling to America with her ailing mother  The two have been robbed by a pickpocket who then loses the money to the Tramp in a card game  The Tramp  feeling sorry for the two penniless women  attempts to secretly place his winnings from his card game in the woman s pocket  but ends up being mistakenly accused of being a pickpocket  The woman manages to clear the Tramp s name  Upon arrival in America  the passengers all stare at the  Statue of Liberty  but once landed the Tramp and the woman part company     Later  hungry and broke  the tramp finds a coin on the street outside a restaurant and pockets it  He doesn t realize there is a hole in his pocket and the coin has fallen straight through and is back on the ground  He enters the restaurant  where he orders a plate of beans  at first eating one bean at a time  There  he is reunited with the woman and discovers her mother is dead  The Tramp orders a second bowl of beans  for her     As they eat  they watch the restaurant s burly head waiter  Campbell  and other waiters attack and forcibly eject a patron who is short 10 cents in paying his bill  The Tramp  intimidated by the waiter  checks and now realizes he has lost his coin  Terrified of facing the same treatment as the man he saw thrown out  the Tramp begins planning how he will fight the huge man  However  a stranger enters  flaunting the coin he found outside  When the head waiter takes the coin it also falls from his pocket onto the floor  The Tramp then makes many failed attempts to retrieve it without notice  He finally retrieves the coin and nonchalantly pays the waiter only to be thunderstruck when the waiter reveals the coin to be fake  Once again  the Tramp prepares for the fight of his life  Just then  a visiting artist spots the Tramp and the woman and offers them a job to pose for a painting  The two agree  The artist offers to pay for the Tramp and the woman s meal  but the Tramp declines the offer several times for reasons of etiquette  intending to eventually accept the artist s offer  however  he s dismayed when the artist does not renew his offer to pay at the last moment  The artist pays for his own meal and leaves a tip for the waiter  The Tramp notices that the tip is enough to cover the couple s meal and  without the artist noticing  palms the tip and presents it to the waiter as his own payment for his and the woman s meal  As a final riposte  he lets the waiter keep the remaining change   one small coin   after paying his bill  The waiter thinks the artist himself has given no tip whatsoever  and is clearly upset at this supposed action     Afterwards  outside a marriage license office in the rain  the Tramp proposes marriage to the woman  who is coy and reluctant until the Tramp physically carries her into the office while she waves her arms and kicks her feet in protest     Episode 1 of the 1983 documentary series   Unknown Chaplin   reveals that Chaplin developed the storyline for  The Immigrant  as filming progressed  Initially  the movie began as a comedy set in an artists  cafe  with Purviance as a brightly dressed patron     This plot was abandoned almost immediately  before Chaplin s character was introduced  the documentary states  and Chaplin began again  with a story  still set in a cafe  about a man who has never been in a restaurant before displaying terrible table manners before meeting a lovely girl  Purviance  and shaping up  Initially   Henry Bergman  played the bully ish head waiter  but Chaplin eventually replaced him with  Eric Campbell      According to  Unknown Chaplin   Chaplin developed the idea of the tramp and Purviance s character being immigrants when he realized he needed more plot to justify the restaurant scenes  After filming the film s opening sequences of the arrival in America  he reshot parts of the restaurant scene to be consistent with the new plot  bringing Bergman back in a new role as an artist who resolves the subplot of Charlie being unable to pay for dinner   and added the epilogue in which the Tramp and Purviance are married     In 1932   Amedee Van Beuren  of Van Beuren Studios  purchased Chaplin s Mutual comedies for  10 000 each  added music by  Gene Rodemich  and  Winston Sharples  and sound effects  and re released them through  RKO Radio Pictures   Chaplin had no legal recourse to stop the RKO release    2       Like many American films of the time   The Immigrant  was subjected to some cuts by  city and state film censorship boards   The Chicago Board of Censors required two cuts to the film  the first being the closeup showing the stealing of a moneybag  and the second involving nose thumbing as an insult    3       A reviewer for the Chicago News wrote   Mr  Chaplin sailed forth yesterday with another mirthful specialty and thereby gave further proof of his popularity and the reason therefore   Wherever The Immigrant invited inspection  thousands flocked to see it  to laugh at and with the famous clown  and learn what new thing he had to offer  and they were amply repaid for their time
