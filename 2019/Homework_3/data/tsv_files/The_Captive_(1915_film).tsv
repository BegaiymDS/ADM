Martinovich  and her Turkish lover  Mahmud Hassan       The Captive  chronicles the life of a young woman named Sonia Martinovitch   Blanche Sweet   who lived during the midst of the  Balkan Wars   She lives close to the  Turkish  border on a small farm in  Montenegro  with her older brother Marko Martinovich   Page Peters   and younger brother Milo   Gerald Ward    Nearby  a Turkish nobleman by the name of Mahmud Hassan   House Peters   lives in a lavish palace  Marko Martinovich fights in the Battle of Lule Burgess  and is tragically killed  leaving Martinovich and her remaining brother  Milo  helpless  Subsequently  Hassan is taken prisoner  and assigned to the Martinovich’s farm to help her with the chores Sonia is unable to complete without her brother     In the beginning  Sonia holds Hassan captive with the use of her bullwhip    5    and forces him to complete tasks like getting water  baking  and plowing fields  Hassan begins to befriend young Milo to alleviate his humiliation and suffering    5    Gradually  Sonia warms up to him and they fall deeply in love     The war waged on  and the Turks recaptured the village where Sonia  Hassan and Milo live  Unfortunately  a drunken officer   William Elmer   tries to force himself on Martinovich  but she refuses  Fueled by love  Hassan intervenes  despite the fact that the officer shares his national origin  When the Turkish army is driven out of the village  Hassan returns home only to be faced with the grim reality that he has been stripped of his title  his land has been taken  and he has banished from his homeland  all for thwarting the drunken officer away from Sonia  Meanwhile  at the farm  a pack of unruly scavengers have burned the Martinovich family’s modest house  forcing them to abandon the place they call home  The siblings meet Hassan on the road  and the lovebirds and Milo walk off to begin a new life together    6       The director   Cecil B  DeMille   and producer   Jesse L  Lasky   are both associated with  Famous Players Lasky Corporation   dubbed “the world’s greatest motion picture enterprise  …  for  it is the organization which has  made  the motion picture”    7    its membership included President  Adolph Zukor   First Vice President  Jesse L  Lasky   Director General  Cecil B  DeMille   Vice Presidents Frank A  Garbott and Walter E  Greene  Treasurer Arthur S  Friend  and Secretary Elek J  Ludvigh  Together  they churned out 731 feature films  and 363 single reel shorts in conjunction with  Paramount   They did this between the years of 1916 and 1919   Blanche Sweet  starred in 19 of the films produced by this organization    7        Paramount  utilized Sweet’s star power to lure audiences into their late spring release  They claimed their films were just as great as  Broadway  stage productions  yet with a never ending season    8    The praise from the press could partially be due to Sweet’s familiarity with her co star   House Peters   as they worked together on another film called   Warrens of Virginia      9     Warrens of Virginia  was directed and produced by the same team    9    Additionally   Motion Picture News  claimed that “Blanche Sweet has scored the greatest success of her entire career in the photodramatization ” The sets and scenes were described as “elaborate …  and  produced with extreme realism ”    9    DeMille’s obsession with realism backfired when an extra  Charles Chandler  was shot and killed by a gun used as a prop on set  Later on   Blanche Sweet  confessed that DeMille encouraged extras to use real bullets instead of blanks to create more realistic battle scenes    3       Sweet  was not a fan of  DeMille  off screen  She starred in two feature films with DeMille   The Captive  and   Warrens of Virginia    and had a negative experience during both  She described her time with DeMille as “‘    a terrible time’ …  she  was terrified of him ”    10    Sweet felt he was strange  but DeMille spun the story to make it sound like he was the one terrified of her  Although Sweet and DeMille didn’t quite click  she had a much better experience with his brother   William C  DeMille   “who  ‘had a more subtle way of doing things ’”    10    She worked with William on three films    The Ragamuffin    The Blacklist   and  The Sowers    These films were all released in 1916    10    DeMille then continued on to direct 70 more films throughout his career    3        Jeanie MacPherson  acted in several of  Cecil B  DeMille  films and  became his favorite screenwriter    3    “Macpherson came to the  Lasky  studio after being fired from  Universal  for going over schedule on one of her short productions ”    3    MacPherson and DeMille worked well together  mostly due to their love of melodrama  In this example of their work  it’s apparent that  The Captive  was designed with the intention of reusing costumes from an earlier film called   The Unafraid    Both films share the same  Eastern European  setting and both leading ladies fall in love with their enemies    3       The film was thought to be a   lost film   until it was rediscovered in 1970 among the silent films stored in the  Paramount Pictures  Vault and later donated to the  Library of Congress    3    where it is now preserved    11
