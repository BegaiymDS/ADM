 (English  intertitles )	Golden Rule Kate   is a 1917 American  silent   western   drama   film  starring  Louise Glaum    William Conklin    Jack Richardson    Mildred Harris   and  John Gilbert   It was  directed  by  Reginald Barker  from a story written by  Monte M  Katterjohn  and  produced  and  distributed  by the  Triangle Film Corporation      The  title role  in this  feature length  western was a big departure for Glaum  One of the leading  vamps  of the mid 1910s—who played wicked dance hall girls in several westerns opposite  William S  Hart —she stars here as the heroine  playing a female Bill Hart  with two pistols  before such roles were common among women     The  setting  is the  Old West  town of Paradise  Nevada  where a young woman  Mercedes Murphy  played by  Louise Glaum    co owns and operates a combination saloon and dance hall called the Red Hen with her business partner  Slick Barney  played by  Jack Richardson    Her little half sister  Olive  Live  Sumner  played by  Mildred Harris    who is crippled  lives with her and she makes every effort to protect the child  A tough  but good hearted businesswoman  Mercedes shows a tender side at home with Live  Her partner  Slick  and a cowboy called the Heller  played by  John Gilbert    who has a heart of gold  are both interested in Live     A reform movement comes to Paradise with the arrival of Reverend Gavin McGregor  played by  William Conklin    who wants to clean up the town and sets up a church next to the saloon and dance hall  Initially  Mercedes is opposed to the church and there is immediate antagonism between her and the reverend  He and Mercedes come to respect each other  however  and she is so impressed by his sermons that she closes down her business     When her little sister is sexually abused  Mercedes blames the reverend and is filled with wrath  She begins a vigorous attack on the church and goes gunning for him  But the Heller discovers that it was actually Mercedes  partner  Slick  who compromised Live s virtue and shoots him dead  After Mercedes learns that it was Slick and not the reverend who betrayed Live  she and the reverend become friends  She closes down the saloon and dance hall permanently and prepares to leave town with Live  The reverend then professes his love for her and begs her to stay     A   Los Angeles Times    review  of Sunday  August 12  1917  reads      Attention to details in the modern photoplay is strenuous work  and particularly is this the case since motion picture  fans  are keenly critical of the most minute errors  Woe to the director who lets hero leave the house with a fedora hat and arrive at the cafe with a derby  or perform any other such discrepancy     In  Golden Rule Kate   in which Louise Glaum is being starred at Clune s Broadway this week  Director Reginald Barker had all the trials that such alternating of scenes necessitates     The production is a big dramatic western play of the Bill Hart type  and all the exteriors were filmed at the Santa Monica ranch studios of the Triangle  where a complete western town has been built for productions of this nature     All through the production the action shifts from the dance hall to the church and from various interiors to the western street  Needless to say that the director and actors had a busy time of it  remembering all the infinitesimal details that combine to make the picture as artistically perfect as possible     Miss Glaum in this new production has a role radically different from her usual  siren  parts  It is a sort of feminized Bill Hart character she portrays as  The Sage Brush Hen   owner of a saloon and dance hall in Paradise  Nev  The picture is full of striking dramatic situations  tense moments and acting  It makes a strong human interest appeal  combining rapid fire action  romance and comedy  Jack Gilbert  Jack Richardson  Mildred Harris  William Conklin  Gertrude Claire and J  P  Lockney form a strong supporting cast for Miss Glaum     1       A  Times  review of Wednesday  August 15  1917  reads       Louise Glaum isn t  vamping  a single  vamp —and she s wearing only one gown in  Golden Rule Kate  at Clune s Broadway  this week  I know this will sound to you just like announcing Bill Hart without Fritz  Mary Pickford without curls  the American people without a vote  or any other national calamity     Yet  Golden Rule Kate  is one of the most original piquant picture plays we ve had in a blue moon  and Monte Katterjohn should mark up a red letter day on his calendar  In this two dimension drama  Miss Glaum plays the role of a young woman who  having come to a new Nevada mining camp with the gold rush  and finding no gold  courageously starts out to run a dance hall  She has her little sister  Mildred Harris  with her  and strives to have the child lead the sheltered life  Along comes a preacher  played with superior strength and sincerity by William Conklin  who in this role proves himself possessed in high degree of a nice sense of dramatic values  At once there is antagonism between Kate—who is a sort of Diana of the dance halls for personal chastity and a sense of justice—and the minister  He is lassoed in his pulpit and dragged to the dance hall  but Kate s sense of fair play is outraged by the act  and she makes the cowboys liberate him  He calls on her  and tells her he misses her at church   And I ve missed you at the dance hall   she says   If you ll tend bar for me for an hour  I ll go to your church next Sunday   says Kate  And he takes her up  with a mixture of humor and devotion to the cause which makes a delicious combination of motive such as is seldom put over on the screen  Of course in the final film foot  she comes into the fold and the minister s embrace     There is some unusually good acting done in this picture  which is directed by Reginald Barker  Jack Gilbert plays  The Heller  with zest  not alone his acting  but his personality getting over wonderfully well  Gertrude Claire  one of the sweetest  mothers  in the films wins a golden place by her acting in this picture  and there is a drunk played by someone whose name I do not know that is an artistic creation in itself     2       Like many American films of the time   Golden Rule Kate  was subject to cuts by  city and state film censorship boards   The Chicago Board of Censors issued the film an Adults Only permit and required the following changes  reel 1  flash gambling scenes and cut all scenes of women embracing men at the bar or women drinking at the bar  reel 2  flash two gambling scenes and cut all but one scene of girl pointing gun at minister and all but one scene of girl with gun holding back crowd at saloon  reel 3  cut close up of blonde woman and man drinking at bar  reel 4  flash all gambling scenes and cut 5 scenes of man and girl embracing at bar  and reel 5  cut scene of shooting man    3       A print film still exists although possibly in an abridged form    4
