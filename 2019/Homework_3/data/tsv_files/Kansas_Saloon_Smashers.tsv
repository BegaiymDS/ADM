American activist Carrie Nation first attacked a saloon in December 1900  silent motion pictures dealing with the subject of alcohol began to be produced  a testament to Nation s national notoriety and her influence over studios at the time    2     Kansas Saloon Smashers  was produced by  Edison Studios  as a parody of Nation s crusade    1      3     Charles Musser   a film historian  writes that  the front page of the   New York Journal   was an excellent indicator of events considered worthy of the  Kinetograph  Department s attention throughout 1901–1902     4       The director of  Kansas Saloon Smashers  was  Edwin S  Porter     1    a  projectionist  who came to work for Edison as a cameraman in 1900  Eventually  Porter became the director responsible for all of Edison Studios  output    5    Porter based the set off of a photograph of a wrecked saloon which appeared in the  Journal   while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper    6      4    Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers would be interested in    6       With production supervised by James H  White    7    Porter was assisted by  George S  Fleming  during the creation of  Kansas Saloon Smashers   Fleming was an actor and scenic designer at Edison Studios  who had joined the studio in January 1901    8    Porter operated the camera for the film  and also developed the footage    9     Kansas Saloon Smashers  marked one of the first short films to be created under Fleming and Porter s partnership    8    While none of the identities of the people who appeared in the picture are recorded    1    it is known the women in the film were played by men in  drag   rendering them sexually unattractive    10        Kansas Saloon Smashers  features  stop action  techniques  used to portray Nation destroying the bar    11    it was shot in  black and white    A copyright was filed for the film on February 2  1903  The finished product comprised around 60 to 65 feet  around 18 m  of  35 mm film     1     Kansas Saloon Smashers  was not the only satire of Nation to be produced by Edison Studios    Why Mr  Nation Wants a Divorce    a comedy picture released the same year  was inspired by news articles on Nation s husband requesting a divorce    4        Kansas Saloon Smashers  has been categorized as  burlesque   re enactment    4    and political satire    12    Being based on a recent news event    10    it is noted as helping further the  visual newspaper  style of film    13    The short portrays saloons as positive  sanitary places rather than immoral establishments    14      15    In Musser s book  The Emergence of Cinema   he writes that  the women s invasion of a male refuge is seemingly attributed to sexual frustration and the concomitant need for revenge     10    while author Karen Blumenthal opined that  Kansas Saloon Smashers  suggests women were only attacking due to a few miscreants being present in the establishments    15       Film critic  Dave Kehr  noted in a 2007   The New York Times   article that  along with  Why Mr  Nation Wants a Divorce   the film now seems dated due to the fact that  the evil influence of liquor is no longer the burning question it was     16    Critic Alan Scherstuhl wrote in   Village Voice   that the film worked as  evidence that the first things our visual mass media culture sold to its audience were comic licentiousness — and the impulse to clean such filth up     17       Initially advertised as  Mrs  Carrie Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade     4     Kansas Saloon Smashers  was distributed by Edison Studios and first released on March 16  1901    1    A unique publicity still was created for the film  a rare occasion at the time    18    Upon release  the film was screened at Bradenburgh s Ninth and Arch Street Museum in  Philadelphia   where it received an entire  bill     4    Nevertheless  the short made Nation and her followers incensed    14    and Nation found the view of saloons Porter s film offered to be  disturbing     3       The film proved to be very successful  inspiring other films about Nation to be produced by other studios   Biograph Company  made  Carrie Nation Smashing a Saloon  in April  while  Lubin Manufacturing Company  had produced a film entitled  Mrs  Nation and Her Hatchet Brigade  by early March    10     Siegmund Lubin  had attempted to capitalize on the success of  Kansas Saloon Smashers  by making a film where Nation herself appeared  when he was unable to contact her  an actress was hired to play her  Lubin arranged with a  Camden  bar owner to film a staged destruction scene  however  the actress proved so convincing that bystanders began to destroy the bar for real and Lubin was forced to pay up to seven hundred dollars damage    19        Kansas Saloon Smashers  film is now in the public domain    1    and a  paper print  is preserved in the  Library of Congress     20    This paper print was used to recover the film for a 2007 DVD release  as part of the compilation  Social Issues in American Film 1900–1934   The compilation  part of the   Treasures from American Film Archives   produced by the  National Film Preservation Foundation   features several films from the period which had particular focus on common issues at their releases  The other Edison produced Nation film   Why Mr  Nation Wants a Divorce   is also included    16
