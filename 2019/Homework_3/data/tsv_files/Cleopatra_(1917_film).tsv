Cleopatre  by  Émile Moreau  and  Victorien Sardou  and   Antony and Cleopatra   by  William Shakespeare     1    The film starred  Theda Bara  in the title role   Fritz Leiber  Sr   as  Julius Caesar   and  Thurston Hall  as  Mark Antony   The film is now considered lost  with only fragments surviving      Because the film has been lost  the following summary is reconstructed from a description in a contemporary film magazine      Cleopatra  Bara   the Siren of Egypt  by a clever ruse reaches Caesar  Leiber  and he falls victim to her charms  They plan to rule the world together  but then Caesar falls  Cleopatra s life is desired by the church  as the wanton woman s rule has become intolerable  Pharon  Roscoe   a high priest  is given a sacred dagger to take her life  He gives her his love instead and  when she is in need of some money  leads her to the tomb of his ancestors  where she tears the treasure from the breast of the  mummy   With this wealth she goes to Rome to meet Antony  Hall   He leaves the affairs of state and travels to Alexandria with her  where they revel  Antony is recalled to Rome and married to Octavia  Blinn   but his soul cries out for Cleopatra  He sends her a message to arm her ships and meet him at Actium  where they  battle  the opposing forces  They are overpowered  and flee to Alexandria  There they are captured by Octavius  De Vries   and Antony dies in Cleopatra s arms  Before Cleopatra is to be dragged behind the wheels of Octavius  chariot  Pharon the priest  who has never ceased to love her  brings her the serpent that she joyously brings to her breast  dying royally with her crown on her head and scepter in her hand as becomes Egypt      Cleopatra  was one of the most elaborate  Hollywood  films ever produced up to that time  with particularly lavish sets and costumes   According to the studio  the film cost  500 000  equivalent to around  9 78 million today  to make and employed 2 000 people behind the scenes  Theda Bara appeared in a variety of costumes  some quite risqué  The film was a great success at the time     The picture was filmed on the Dominquez slough just outside  Long Beach  California   The throne prop used in the film ended up  years later  in the possession of  Leon Schlesinger Productions   its disposition after the acquisition of that company by  Warner Bros   is unknown    2       Like many American films of the time   Cleopatra  was subject to cuts by  city and state film censorship boards   For example  the Chicago Board of Censors required the following cuts     in Reel 1  three scenes of the Queen posing before Caesar with her navel exposed  ascending stairs to throne and suggestively leaning against him  two scenes of Queen lying on couch with Caesar standing near  Reel 2  Queen in objectionable costume turning as she embraces Caesar  first and last scenes of Queen at astrologer s table looking into crystal  Reel 3  first scene of Queen at harp and on couch before she goes to dais  two closeups of Queen on dais bending over  two full length views of Queen in chariot exposing her legs  two views of Queen on couch awakening from sleep  Reel 4  entire incident of

walking to throne in costume exposing body    3       After the  Hays Code  was implemented in Hollywood   Cleopatra  was judged to be too  obscene  to be shown      citation needed      However  despite its controversies  the film was a huge box office draw  becoming one of the most successful blockbusters of 1917     The last two prints known to exist were destroyed in fires at the  Fox studios  in 1937  along with the majority of Bara s other films for Fox  and at the  Museum of Modern Art  in  New York City     4      5     and the majority of the film is now considered  lost     6      7     Only brief fragments of footage are known to survive    4      8       Filmmaker and film historian  Phillip Dye  is reconstructing  Cleopatra  on video  titled  Lost Cleopatra   editing together still picture montages combined with the surviving film clip  The script is based on the original scenario with modifications based on research into censorship reports  reviews of the film and synopses from period magazines    9    Dye screened the film at the  Hollywood Heritage Museum  on February 8  2017    10
