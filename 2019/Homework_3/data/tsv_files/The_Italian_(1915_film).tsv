but instead winds up working as a  shoeshiner  and experiencing tragedy while living with his wife and child in a tenement on New York s  Lower East Side    The film was produced by  Thomas H  Ince   directed by  Reginald Barker   and co written by  C  Gardner Sullivan  and Ince   The film stars stage actor  George Beban  in the title role as the Italian immigrant  Pietro  Beppo  Donnetti  In 1991  this film was deemed  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant  by the United States  Library of Congress  and selected for preservation in the  National Film Registry      The film tells the story of Pietro  Beppo  Donnetti   Donnetti is a poor  but happy   gondolier  in  Venice  Italy    Beppo falls in love with Annette Ancello  but her father  Trudo  wants her to marry another suitor  one who is a successful businessman   If Beppo can prove himself within a year  Trudo agrees to allow him to marry Annette     Beppo sails for America to make his fortune  making a living working as a  shoeshiner  on a street corner in New York City   He borrows money from an Irish ward boss  Bill Corrigan  and sends for Annette to join him   In exchange  Beppo agrees to help Corrigan s candidate win the Italian vote in the ward     When Annette arrives in New York  she and Beppo are married  and the following year they have a son  Tony   Beppo  Annette and Tony live a happy life in their Lower East Side tenement   The happiness is interrupted when the baby contracts a fever during a heatwave   The doctor instructs them to feed pasteurized milk to the baby   Beppo works hard to earn the money to purchase the expensive milk   While walking to the store to buy the milk  Beppo is robbed   He attacks the men who robbed him and is arrested   Beppo asks Corrigan to help his baby while he is in jail   I must get a de milk or my babee is die   Corrigan rebuffs Beppo  and Beppo s baby dies during Beppo s five days in jail     When Beppo is released from jail  he learns that Corrigan s young daughter is ill and vows to avenge his son s death by killing Corrigan s daughter   Beppo sneaks into Corrigan s house  but when he sees Corrigan s daughter lying in her crib  he cannot act on his plan  and he leaves the child unharmed     In the final scene of the narrative  Beppo  is shown placing flowers and sobbing over his son s grave     The film employs a prologue and epilogue to frame the narrative story   In the prologue  a stage curtain rises and shows the lead actor  George Beban  in an upper class apartment wearing a smoking jacket   He sits on a couch and opens a book titled  The Italian  by Thomas H  Ince and C  Gardner Sullivan   As he begins reading  the film fades into the narrative story   In the epilogue  the film shifts from the image of Beppo kneeling at his son s grave to Beban turning to the last page of the book  closing the book and looking thoughtful   The stage curtain is then drawn closed     Some critics have suggested the prologue and epilogue were intended to demonstrate the care with which Beban  a noted stage actor  had selected a story worthy of his talents     Historical accounts indicate that Thomas Ince and C  Gardner Sullivan had originally titled their project  Dago   but agreed to change the title at the request of the film s star   George Beban     1     The Italian  marked the first motion picture role for Beban  who had gained acclaim as a Broadway actor and vaudevillian specializing in ethnic caricatures    2    Beban only agreed to join the project for a salary of  7000 and a percentage of the films profits    3       Ince and Sullivan are credited with writing the film s story  but film historian Kevin Brownlow has shown that the plot was essentially lifted from the earlier  Independent Moving Pictures   Ince s former employer  film   The Wop   1913      3       Though set on  Manhattan  s  Lower East Side   the New York scenes for  The Italian  were shot in the immigrant quarter of  San Francisco     4     While most accounts indicate that the scenes of Beppo as a gondolier were shot in  the Venice district of Los Angeles   an account published by the  Los Angeles Times  in November 1914 reported that  Ince sent Beban to Italy to get special canal scenes for the eight reel play     5       One of the vivid scenes in  The Italian  is the fight scene between Beppo and his muggers   The scene lasts five minutes on the screen  and a newspaper story reported that  for realism   a number of the biggest men at Inceville were used in the scene     6       In a story on the production of  The Italian   a newspaper reported that a hundred pounds of rice were bought for the film s wedding scene   An initial order of fifty pounds of rice was left uncovered overnight by a  property man  at the Inceville studio   A  heavy rain caused each grain to swell to enormous proportions   requiring the purchase of another fifty pounds of rice    7        Upon the release of  The Italian   the  Los Angeles Times  gave the film a positive review which included the following comments     There are possibilities in the role of Pietro  in  The Italian      that a less clever character artist than George Beban might overlook      The story is full of human interest  requiring a full understanding of the character  and Beban by look and gesture is at all times in fullest sympathy with the difficult role       A ll go to make a story that pulsates with human interest   The pathos of the child s death because of the lack of necessities and the imprisonment of the poor Italian furnish the real lesson of the Ghetto     8       The Washington Post  called it  a fascinating story     9    and  a simple story of ghetto life  showing that love  faith  and loyalty are not unknown quantities in this dark sphere     10        A newspaper in  Fort Wayne  Indiana  praised the film for its  rare quality of charm and a warmth of appeal that is truly unique  and concluded   Here is a story beautiful and exquisite in theme      Its simplicity and utter humanness have an appeal that reaches straight to the heart of the onlooker     11     Another review in the same paper also commended the  simple beauty of the story itself  and also praised Beban s performance     George Beban  who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti  gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous   This artist has developed mimicry to its highest form of expression   His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly  each varying mood was portrayed so truly  that it was hard to believe that this man was naught but a pantomimist   The upward glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion  the hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits  all these phrases were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled     12      A newspaper in  San Antonio  Texas  praised the  vein of innocent humor  that runs through the film at the expense of Beppo and concluded    The Italian  is regarded as Thomas H  Ince s masterpiece and is said to be greater than his  Wrath of the Gods    The Typhoon  and  The Bargain      13        In 2008   The Italian  was released on DVD as part of a two disc compilation titled   Perils of the New Land  Films of the Immigrant Experience  1910 1915     At the time of the DVD release   The New York Times  praised the film for  Reginald Barker  s strong direction  including his use of a mobile camera and  liberal use of close up  which give the film a subjective  personal feel    4     The  Times  also praised Beban s  powerful lead performance  which it described as follows     The audience is drawn to identify with Beppo  even though he remains in many respects an appalling ethnic caricature  dark  brooding  vengeful  That Barker and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for Beppo  despite their own  occasionally quite obvious condescension to the character  is a mark of emerging maturity in the movie business  no longer are films dealing in one dimensional  types      4      The  Los Angeles Times  in 2008 described  The Italian  as  a shameless melodrama that  despite unfortunate stereotypes  musters considerable sympathy for its titular immigrant     14     The  Times  also noted that  Beban  the silent era star known for his ethnic impersonations  hams up a storm as Beppo  a jaunty Venetian     14        The film publication   Cineaste   published a review of  The Italian  in March 2009  focusing on the film s depiction of the Italian American immigrant experience as a Darwinian jungle rather than a promised land paved with gold     Against  Horatio Alger  expectations   The Italian  is a story of failure suffused with a soft focused  dappled nostalgia for the old country      From sunny Italy to the New York ghetto   read the taglines on Paramount s original  one sheet   contrasting scenes of  carefree Beppo at home  in the serene canals of Old Italy with the mean streets of New York where  to live your baby must have Pasteurized milk   America is not a promised land paved with gold but a Darwinian jungle  where dreams meet dead ends     15      Cineaste also credited Beban for his intense performance  commenting on the fight sequence in which Beban s character  seethes with murderous determination  as the camera focuses on his face in an extreme close up   Beban s sudden transformation from amiability to wrath recalls the first glimpse of  Spencer Tracy  after nearly being lynched in  Fritz Lang  s   Fury       15        A reviewer for the publication  Bright Sights  wrote that the film had a powerfully downbeat conclusion with a social message     Projecting overwhelming grief  Beban reveals some hefty acting chops  and  The Italian  certainly gets its liberal point across  a model of how American movies dress social consciousness in the garb of melodrama  Even here  in its infancy  feature film was eager to pick up the call for social reform that sounded out in urban America before the First World War     16       In his 2004 historical book on the depiction of Italians in Hollywood movies  Peter Bondanella praised the film     A number of elements sets  The Italian  apart from the other films treating the Italian immigrant experience      Its melodramatic plot reflects a serious sense of artistic construction  aimed at milking the last bit of emotion out of the audience   George Beban s outstanding performance shows his roots in the dramatic theater      Finally  the depiction of the tragic story of Beppo shows a certain sympathy for the character of the poor Italian bootblack but also includes a callous disregard for depicting Italian immigrants in a stereotypical manner  an attitude that no doubt reflected the opinions of the majority of Americans at the time   Its plot is simple and compelling     17      Despite its occasional use of patronizing stereotypes  Bondanella concludes that Beppo  is represented with great dignity and even comic twists  making Beppo a far more lovable figure than one might expect     18     He concludes his chapter on the film with the following comment   In short  what emerges from  The Italian  is an unusually complex view of tenement life and multiethnic immigration in America  and the film consequently retains its value not only as social history but also as a work of art     19       In his book about the history of film editing  Don Fairservice credits  The Italian  s director   Reginald Barker   for his early use of editing to maintain story continuity and for his use of multidirectional camera positioning and variable framing to emphasize character development and psychological motivation rather than plot    20        A review in  DVD Talk  concluded that Beban s performance was able to overcome the film s melodramatic premise     Beppo is a delightful character     His rage after being robbed was another standout moment   The camera does a very tight closeup  one of the closest I can recall for a film from 1915  and his anger and fear are almost palatable       The ending of the film is also very dramatic and works well  without a false Hollywood happy ending     It was nice to see the hardships of poverty portrayed without any easy answers  something that doesn t often happen     21
