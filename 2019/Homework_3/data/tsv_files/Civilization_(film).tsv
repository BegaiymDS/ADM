United States	Silent film  English  intertitles	Civilization   is a 1916 American  pacifist   allegorical   drama film  produced by  Thomas H  Ince   written by  C  Gardner Sullivan  and  Edward Sloman   and directed by Ince   Reginald Barker  and  Raymond B  West   The story involves a submarine commander who refuses to fire at a civilian ocean liner supposedly carrying ammunition for his country s enemies  The film was a big budget spectacle that was compared to both   The Birth of a Nation   and the paintings of  Jean François Millet    The film was a popular success and was credited by the  Democratic National Committee  with helping to re elect  Woodrow Wilson  as the  U S  President  in 1916  The film was also one of the first to depict  Jesus Christ  as a character in a motion picture  leading some to criticize the depiction as in  poor taste       Civilization  is sometimes viewed as one of the first  anti war films   In 1999  it was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant     1       The film opened with a lengthy prologue   In some theaters  the prologue was performed by live actors and an orchestra    2     It included music composed by  Victor Schertzinger  and depicted a peaceful country home  with hills in the distance  a stream and clouds floating peacefully through the sky  Suddenly  the boom of a cannon is heard  artillery guns belch fire  and a Zeppelin flies over the city dropping bombs   In the smoke   Civilization  is depicted kneeling pleadingly at the feet of a menacing  God of War    Soldiers are seen retreating before deadly gas    2     Against these scenes  the film s title cards express the film s anti war message  concluding with the following comments     Today  the great sorrowful eyes of this same Son of God gaze down upon blackened fields  where the mangled bodies of men are strewn as grains of wheat  upon flaming shattered hamlets and stricken firesides   As He listens to the screaming of the shells  the crashing of monstrous guns  all the ghastly symphony of the reddest war mankind has ever known  His heart must recognize the bitter truth in the statement of one of the world s foremost educators— That in nineteen centuries Civilization has failed to accept honestly the teachings of Jesus Christ   This is an allegorical story of  a war  that has laughed at the world s flaunting boast of a higher progress  It does not concern itself as to which side is in the right or wrong  but deals with those ranks which are paying  the grim penalty—the ranks of Humanity   If the awful trail of battle stretches vividly through the scenes of the narrative  it is in the hope that a shocked and appalled world may henceforth devote itself more earnestly in the cause of peace   Let our Civilization not be a mockery of our cherished ideals  but rather a synonym of that glorious work—Humanity   Dedicated to that vast  pitiful army whose tears have girdled the universe—the mothers of the dead    The film opens with the outbreak of a war in the previously peaceful kingdom of Wredpryd   Count Ferdinand is the inventor of a new submarine who is assigned to command the new ship in battle   The King of Wredpryd orders the Count to sink the   ProPatria     for my country    a civilian ship that is believed to be carrying munitions as well as civilian passengers   In his mind s eye  the Count sees a vision of what would happen if he sent a torpedo crashing into the liner  and he recoils   He refuses to follow his orders  saying he is  obeying orders    from a Higher Power    Realizing his crew will carry out the orders  the Count fights with the crew and blows up his submarine  sending it to the bottom of the sea     The Count s soul descends into purgatory  where he encounters Jesus   Jesus announces that the Count can find redemption by returning to the living world as a voice for peace   Jesus tells the Count   Peace to thee  child  for in thy love for humanity is thy redemption   In thy earthly body will I return  and with thy voice plead for peace  Much evil is being wrought in my name      The Count returns to life and is stoned and reviled by his countrymen   He is put on trial by the king  a modern  Pontius Pilate   and is sentenced to death  Five thousand women gather at the palace singing a song of peace and pleading with the king to end the war   The mothers  plea inspires the king to visit the cell of the condemned Count   The Count is found dead in his cell  and Jesus emerges from the Count s body and takes the king on a tour of the battlefields   Jesus asks   See here thy handiwork   Under thy reign  thy domain hath become a raging hell    In the film s most famous scene  Jesus walks through the battlefields amid the carnage of war     The signing of a peace treaty follows  and the closing scenes depicts the happiness in store for the returning soldiers      Civilization  was a big budget spectacle from Thomas H  Ince   It was in production for nearly a year and reportedly cost  1 000 000 to make     The film s screenwriter   C  Gardner Sullivan   said he received the inspiration for the film on Easter Sunday morning in 1915   He wrote an outline on a single piece of typewriter paper  originally calling it  The Mothers of Men    Sullivan showed the outline to Ince  and Ince decided it was worth investing a million dollars    2       In April 1916  the  Los Angeles Times  wrote     The next large feature looming on the horizon is the Ince photoplay   Civilization      It was nearly a year in the making   and is the most pretentious of the Ince features   Many hundreds of persons took part  and it is said that the film contains some of the most beautiful photography ever shown on the screen    3      At the time of its release  it was described as  the ultimate achievement of the Ince studios     4       The film included large scale battle scenes  scenes of naval battles  trench warfare  aerial battles  and the resulting devastation   Ships from the United States Navy were utilized in the scenes depicting sea battles    4     Advertising for the film   pictured at right   boasted of the extravagant expense incurred in presenting the spectacle     Actual Sinking of an Ocean Liner   Two Battleships Sunk by United States Navy    18 000 Used for Ammunition in One Battle   40 000 People Employed   10 000 Horses in Thrilling Cavalry Charges   40 Aeroplanes in Great Air Battle   Every Death dealing Device Known to Modern War in Operation   One Year in the Making   Cost  1 000 000 00   Entire Cities Built and Destroyed   An Awe inspiring Spectacle that one minute makes your blood run cold and another thrills you with its touches of human gentleness   The Story of the Greatest Love of the Ages —  the Love of Humanity    5        George Fisher  was given the daunting role of playing  The Christ  in  Civilization    He was  the first cinema actor to portray Christ for the screen     6     At the time of the film s release  Fisher told the  Los Angeles Times  that  to get in the proper mood for the role   he lived the life of a recluse  spending his time in study and meditation     6     He expressed his hope that the film s message would be heard     I can say in truth that the playing of this part has affected my whole life and the impressions will never leave me   I have tried earnestly and sincerely  with a deep prayer in my heart  to bring a message to the world  one which will reach  perhaps  millions   Now my only wish is that whoever may witness the performances of  Civilization  will realize only the truth and beauty of the message    6      The film was a popular success when it was released in 1916  The Democratic National Committee credited the film with helping to  re elect President Woodrow Wilson in 1916     7    After the  United States s entry into World War I   the film was pulled from distribution    7       Film director  Yasujirō Ozu  claimed that he first decided to become a film director when watching  Civilization     8       Among critics  the reaction was mixed     In  La Crosse  Wisconsin   a newspaper reviewer called it a  masterpiece  and the  Biggest Spectacle in History of Motion Pictures   surpassing even  D W  Griffith  s   Birth of a Nation       The photoplay and the spoken drama will be united for the first time in     the million dollar masterpiece of Thomas H  Ince      Civilization  is an encyclopedia of the emotions   It is inevitable to compare such a picture  epic in its scope  including battles and the upheaval of a nation  to a similar picture  Griffith s  Birth of a Nation   Ince has excelled his predecessor in the art of suggestion  In the vivid battle scenes of  Civllization   there are four suggestive flashes for every one Griffith gave us  The conception is classically correct  No theater could be conceived that would be adequate in space or speed of action to carry across to an audience what was conveyed in this film    2      In Indiana  a reviewer emphasized the film s spectacular effects and its depiction of Jesus      If Christ Should Visit  Verdun   would make a good subtitle for  Civilization   for that is really its theme      Pictorially  and in the spectacular effects that can be achieved within range of the camera  as well as in the sheer beauty of many of its scenes  it is a masterpiece indeed  Days of peace in the little town of Wrepryd  which is its locale  and in the peaceful country thereabout  might have been posed by the artist  Millet   so strikingly do they stand out    As far north as  Fairbanks  Alaska   a reviewer wrote that  if the film had been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war      Civilization  is worth  1 50 today  tomorrow  or at any time  It is a masterpiece—a picture that grips and thrills  It preaches a powerful sermon and preaches it in a way that makes it interesting      After seeing  Civilization  one can truthfully say that had  Henry Ford  produced a film like this one that Ince directed  and sent it broadcast throughout the civilized world as an argument against war  he would have accomplished more for universal peace than did his famous   peace expedition    He would have reached the great mass of people who have but a faint recollection of the horrors of war  and would have showed them the pain and the suffering and the sorrow that war brings with it  Had such a picture as  Civilization  been shown to the people of Europe before the war started there would have been no war    9      Henry Christeen Warnack in the  Los Angeles Times  was troubled by the depiction of The Christ and wrote that the film  is not daring  it is only poor taste     10     He opined that it was offensive to the beliefs of Christians  Jews and atheists alike      T he play will     be popular with everybody with the exception of three classes  It will probably prove offensive to Christians because they are likely to think of it as irreverent  to the Hebrew it will seem mystical and exaggerated  the non church goer will find it absurd and undramatic   Outside of the Christian  the Jew and the unbeliever  I haven t the sligthest    sic     doubt of its appeal    10      Warnack concluded his review as follows     This violation of good taste and this error in judgment belong to the misconception of the story      Realizing the vast sum of money and the huge investment of talent and good faith that have been expended in this pretentious film  it is with deep regret that I am compelled to report it as a disappointment    10       World War One
