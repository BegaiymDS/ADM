Edwin McKim	Ivan Film Productions	Ivan Abramson	Lea Leland and Leonid Samoloff	1914	United States	Silent film  English  intertitles	Should a Woman Divorce    is a  1914   silent film  written by  Ivan Abramson  and directed by  Edwin McKim   and starring Lea Leland and Leonid Samoloff     Grace Roberts  played by Lea Leland   marries rancher Edward Smith  who is revealed to be a neglectful  vice ridden spouse   They have a daughter  Vivian   Dr  Franklin  Leonid Samoloff  whisks Grace away from this unhappy life  and they move to New York under aliases  pretending to be married  since surely Smith would not agree to a divorce    Grace and Franklin have a son  Walter   Milton S  Gould     Vivian gets sick  however  and Grace and Franklin return to save her    Somehow this reunion  as Smith had assumed Grace to be dead  causes the death of Franklin    This plot device frees Grace to return to her father s farm with both children    1       The film was not favorably reviewed by critics  as Robert B  Connelly s 1998 volume on silent films succinctly describes it as a  stinker     1      Variety   noted that  it needed five parts  reels  to unwind this Immoral and Impossible story  and still it didn t answer  Should a Woman Divorce     2     Hanford C  Judson of  Moving Picture World  described the film as  crammed full of humanity  but has no social propaganda at all   It is simply a story that  Ivan Abramson  has made up  using what license he needed  such as total disregard of American divorce laws  to make his picture entertaining    Judson also noted the picture s  distinct Semitic atmosphere  despite its supposed farming area setting  which is an astute observation as Jewish writer producer Ivan Abramson had emigrated from Russia and this was one of his first films   Actor Leonid Samoloff was an accomplished  tenor  who had also emigrated from Russia    3      4      5       The film was directed by  Edwin McKim   husband of actress  Anna Lehr   who are perhaps best known as the parents of actress  Ann Dvorak    Some sources list  Edward McKim  as the director of the film  but that appears to be an error    6       Abramson s grandson  Milton S  Gould  was cast in the role of Grace s son Walter    7
