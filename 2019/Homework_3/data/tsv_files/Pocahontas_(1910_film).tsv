was met with praise by most reviewers  It is believed that a replica of  Hendrik Hudson  s ship    Halve Maen    was used for the opening scene to establish the Jamestown landing  Though minor costuming and historical accuracy errors were pointed out  the film was praised as being of the highest quality of any Independent company  The film is presumed  lost      Though the film is presumed  lost   a synopsis survives in   The Moving Picture World   from October 15  1910  It states    Captain John Smith  comes to America as the head of a band of English colonists and settles in  Jamestown  Virginia   While at the head of the colony Smith makes a trip of exploration into the interior and is captured there by  King Powhatan   the acknowledged head of all of the red men in Virginia  Powhatan orders his prisoner s execution  Just as the fatal club is about to descend   Pocahontas   the favorite daughter of the King  throws herself before her father  She begs so fervently that the white man s life be spared that Powhatan relents and orders his release  Captain Smith returns in safety to his friends  Later Pocahontas is taken prisoner by the English and held as hostage  While a prisoner  she is converted to Christianity  and falls in love with  Rolfe   a handsome young Englishman  They are married in a rude little church at Jamestown  and the Indian princess sails away with her husband to England  There she is received with royal honors by  King James I   but the foreign flower cannot stand transplanting  She soon sickens and dies  and in her last hours is visited by visions of the home in the wilderness that she would fly back to if she could     1       The story was adapted from  Lydia Sigourney  s  Pocahontas  poem by  Lloyd Lonergan   Originally published in 1841 as part of  Pocahontas and Other Poems   Film historian  Q  David Bowers  states that while the story of Pocahontas was well known  few people had ever read Sigourney s poem    1    Lonergan an experienced newspaperman employed by   The New York Evening World   while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions    2    The film director is unknown  but it may have been  Barry O Neil   Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production  but at least two possible candidates exist   Blair Smith  was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company  but he was soon joined by  Carl Louis Gregory  who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer  The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions    3     Anna Rosemond   a leading lady of the company  played the key role of Pocahontas and  Frank H  Crane   a leading male actor  played the role of  John Rolfe     1      4      5     George Barnes  was cast in the role of  Captain John Smith  and it marked his first known credited Thanhouser appearance  Barnes played the role of the bandit who shot Broncho Billy in  Edwin S  Porter    s   The Great Train Robbery      6    The rest of the cast credits are unknown  but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary listings    7    In late 1910  the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films  The list includes  G W  Abbe    Justus D  Barnes    Irene Crane    Marie Eline    Violet Heming    Martin J  Faust    Thomas Fortune    George Middleton    Grace Moore    John W  Noble    Mrs  George Walters     8    According to a reviewer of the film  the cast included real  Native Americans     9       It is believed that a reproduction of  Hendrik Hudson  s ship    Halve Maen    English  Half Moon    was used in the film  The replica was originally constructed for the  Hudson Fulton Celebration  in 1909    1    This belief comes from the identification of the vessel by   The New York Dramatic Mirror   reviewer who states   One scene shows the copy of Henry Hudson s vessel used in the Hudson Fulton celebration  and it is supposed in the film to represent the ship that brought John Smith and his party to America     1    Another reviewer from   The Moving Picture World   confirms the usage in the production   We all know the story  but it was left for this enterprising concern to show us John Smith landing from the Half Moon  which was borrowed for the occasion  This occurs at the very beginning and gives the film a stamp of reality that seldom has been obtained in any historical subject     9    One flaw in the production was the scene in which Pocahontas appears in the court of King James and the setting draws attention over the action itself  The lack of a throne and unusual shaped windows  likened to those of a  conservatory  or  enclosed veranda  by the reviewer  diminishing the effect of the short scene    9       The single reel drama  approximately 1 000 feet long  was released on October 11  1910    1    The film likely had a wide national release  with known showings in  North Carolina     10     Indiana     11     Montana     12    and  Kansas     13       The film was widely praised by supporters of the Independents and minimally praised by the reviewer for  The New York Dramatic Mirror  which was chiefly loyal to the Licensed companies    14    A review in   The Moving Picture News   stated   Never did any Licensed manufacturer turn out a better picture  and seldom have they turned out one that s equal  The details  the settings  the staging and the acting  not neglecting the photography  put this picture way above par     1    Walton  also of  The Moving Picture News  affirmed that the quality of the film  but acknowledged some minor historical accuracy points in the production itself  Walton concluded   Such films as these lift moving picturedom into the higher plane  where its most enduring successes will be won  The presentation  in such a worthy form as this  of the timber from whence our nation has been hewn  cannot but meet with commendation  I feel sure England will welcome this stately production with as hearty a welcome as it has received  and merited  in New York     1      The Moving Picture World   also confirmed the quality of the production as one which further elevates the reputation of the Thanhouser Company    1       Standing in contrast    The New York Dramatic Mirror   review criticized the production for being  too crowded for pictorial beauty and too stiffly acted for dramatic effect  The picture  therefore  falls short of the mark aimed at  although it is not unworthy of some praise      There are a number of flaws in the costuming that should not go unnoticed   the cloth trousers worn by some of the Indians  the iron hatchets carried by at least two of them  the corsets and tailor made fancy Indian costume worn by Pocahontas     1    The  Mirror  however was not impartial and was seen as an organ of the Licensed films  Despite this  the reviews were perceptive and were usually favorable to Thanhouser productions    14      note 1
