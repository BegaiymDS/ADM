Williams	Thanhouser Film Corporation	Mutual Film Corporation	November 18, 1915  ( 1915-11-18 )	United States	Silent (English  intertitles )	Inspiration   is a 1915 American  silent   drama film  written by  Virginia Tyler Hudson  and  directed  by  George Foster Platt  and starring  Audrey Munson   It is notable for being the first non  pornographic  American film to feature  full nudity  of a woman  On reissue in 1918  the film was called   The Perfect Model    All copies of the movie are believed to have been  lost     1       A young  sculptor  searches for the perfect  model  to inspire his work  He finds a poverty stricken girl who he thinks is the one he has been  looking for  When she wanders off  he visits all the famous statues in  Manhattan  hoping to find her again      Inspiration   was released November 18  1915  Thanhouser s publicity department issued a press statement titled  Inspiration  a Study in Thanhouser Ideals   an interview some newspapers captioned in terms that implied that the studio advocated nudity in motion pictures  Producer  Edwin Thanhouser  wrote a letter to the editor of   The Morning Telegraph   to correct that impression   I wish to state that our five reel Mutual Masterpiece  Inspiration  was viewed and passed on by the National Board of Censorship without a single alteration     2         Inspiration  presents a decided novelty  for it is the first moving picture in which the nude figure of a woman has been used for artistic reasons only   wrote  The Morning Telegraph   which reported Munson s credentials as one of the most famous artist s models in the United States   Miss Munson s classic beauty and her remarkable poise absolutely remove every suggestion of the objectionable   wrote the reviewer   George Foster Platt  who directed the picture  has used the utmost delicacy producing the picture  and it would have to be a very prudish person who could find any serious objection to the film  The story is too insignificant to sustain the interest for five reels  but the many beautiful poses of Miss Munson will do more than make up for the lack of a good plot  The picture will attract more than usual interest and the delicate and attractive way that a difficult subject has been filmed will no doubt receive the praise it deserves     2       Likewise  a reviewer for   The Moving Picture World   regarded the story as  slight and conventional   while another credited the film for  presenting a conventional but reasonably diverting story  … Moreover  it may be noted in favor of  Inspiration  that it possesses an artistic  and at times  even an educational value  Good taste has been displayed in the handling of scenes that might easily become coarse     2       Critics praised the third reel of the film  which details the difficult process of molding Munson s body in plaster for the casting of a sculpture    2        At last true art has stepped into the motion field and it is all due to Audrey Munson  the Panama Pacific model who has gained much fame about of late owing to her shapely figure   wrote   Variety     There is a bit of a story  It is trivial  however  It is about an artist unable to get a satisfactory model  His friends find a country girl who never posed before  She needs the money  She is capable from the minute she starts and immediately wins fame for the sculptor  There is a bit of love mixed in with the model and artist being joined at the altar  After all the posing that girl did that boy took no chance whatever when he married her  for there was nothing hidden from him  It is one nude pose after another  Miss Munson is always the central and bare figure  The picture has an educational trend as well as being artful  This will make some dizzy  but bookers should get busy  It s a cuckoo     2
