Louis J. Gasnier Donald MacKenzie	Charles W. Goddard  George B. Seitz	Arthur C. Miller	General Film Company  &amp; Eclectic Film Company	March 31, 1914  ( 1914-03-31 )	20 chapters (total of 410 minutes)	United States	Silent	The Perils of Pauline   is a 1914 American  melodrama   film serial  shown in weekly installments  featuring  Pearl White  as the title character  Pauline has often been remembered as a famous example of a  damsel in distress   although contemporaneous reception and  some analyses  hold that her character was more resourceful and less helpless than the classic damsel stereotype    1    and she was a considerable influence on early female audiences and attracted much critical attention therefore    2    Pauline is menaced by assorted  villains   including  pirates  and Indians  Neither  Pauline  nor its successor    The Exploits of Elaine    used the  cliffhanger  format in which a serial episode ends with an unresolved danger that is addressed at the beginning of the next installment  Although each episode placed Pauline in a situation that looked sure to result in her imminent death  the end of each installment showed how she was rescued or otherwise escaped the danger  Despite popular associations  Pauline was never tied to railroad tracks in the series  an image that comes instead from contemporaneous films such as   Barney Oldfield s Race for a Life       The serial had 20 episodes  the first being three reels  30 minutes   and the rest two reels  20 minutes  each  After the original run  it was reshown in theaters a number of times  sometimes in edited  shortened versions  through the 1920s  Today   The Perils of Pauline  is known to exist only in a shortened 9 chapter version  approximately 214 minutes   released in Europe in 1916    3       In 2008   The Perils of Pauline  was selected by the  Library of Congress  for the United States  National Film Registry   as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant      The premise of the story was that Pauline s wealthy guardian Mr  Marvin  upon his death  has left her inheritance in the care of his secretary  Mr  Koerner  until the time of her marriage  Pauline wants to wait a while before marrying  as her dream is to go out and have adventures to prepare herself for becoming an author  Mr  Koerner  hoping to ultimately keep the money for himself  tries to turn Pauline s various adventures against her and have her  disappear  to his own advantage     Pearl White was hesitant to accept the title role  but signed up for  250 week and a large amount of  publicity    4        William Randolph Hearst  was involved in plot development   He was also present at the premiere at Loew s Broadway Theatre  on March 23  1914   According to  The Truth About Pearl White  by Wallace E  Davis  the general release was approximately April 1  1914    5       E  A  McManus  head of the Hearst Vitagraph service organization  was the person who proved how successful a serial could be   He co operated with the largest film equipment and production company in the world at that time  a France based company named  Pathé   to produce this serial  which was Pathé s first entry into the medium    4      5     George B  Seitz  tried to follow the cliffhanging pattern of   The Adventures of Kathlyn   but each chapter was mostly self contained    5       After retiring from law enforcement   William J  Flynn   former director of the  Bureau of Investigation   forerunner of the  FBI    became a scenario writer for the motion picture industry through his acquaintance with the actor  King Baggot   who was considered the greatest film star in the country at that time in 1912  Producers Theodore and Leopold Wharton commissioned him to write story lines for their films  including  Pauline   The Whartons also eventually adapted Flynn s experiences into a 20 part spy thriller titled  The Eagle s Eye   1918   starring Baggot    6       Surviving chapters of  Pauline  are noteworthy for their unintentionally funny title cards and dialogue captions  filled with misspellings  poor punctuation  terrible grammar  and odd expressions  This happened when Pathé  the theatrical distributor  exported the film to  France   The film was recut and adapted for home movie use  and all of the printed captions were translated into  French   Later  when the American home movie industry beckoned  the original  English  titles had been scrapped  so the French technicians tried to translate the titles back into English    5      7     These errors have also been blamed on  Louis J  Gasnier   director and supervisor of the production  Gasnier  as explained by  Crane Wilbur   made linguistic mistakes that confused the French speaking crew    4     In either case  current prints of  The Perils of Pauline  contain these badly re translated title cards   Thus  in  The Pirate s Treasure   Pauline detects a time bomb and says   What is that tic tac I can hear   In the same episode  she spies one of the quaint locals and observes   Here is an original old man   The new title cards also renamed the villain s character   Raymond Owen  was now called  Koerner   in reference to German  villainy  during  World War I      Much of the film was shot in  Fort Lee  New Jersey   where many early  film studios  in  America s first motion picture industry  were based at the beginning of the 20th century    8      9      10    Scenes were also filmed in  Pittsburgh    Pennsylvania     11    and  Staten Island    New York     12    The term   cliffhanger   may have originated with the series  owing to a number of episodes filmed on or around the  New Jersey Palisades —though it is also likely to refer to situations in stories of this type where the hero or heroine is hanging from a cliff  seemingly with no way out  until the next episode or last minute resolution     Pearl White performed most of her own stunts for the serial  but also was stunt doubled by a man   Filmed in the Adirondacks in New York  the stunt double rode a horse off a cliff into the lake below   Considerable risk was involved   In one incident  a balloon carrying White escaped and carried her across the  Hudson River  into a storm  before landing miles away  In another incident her back was permanently injured in a fall    5       Although never actually proven  one of the more famous scenes in the serial which depicted a curved railroad bridge was supposedly the Ingham Creek trestle in  New Hope  Pennsylvania  on the Reading Company s New Hope Branch  now the  New Hope and Ivyland Railroad  line   The trestle still stands  just off Ferry Street along a private driveway  Some even nickname it Pauline s Trestle  The railroad is a tourist attraction and offers rides from New Hope to Lahaska  Pennsylvania  crossing over the original trestle  Other supposed locations for the railroad scenes include the  Belvidere Delaware Railroad  in  Lambertville  and  Raven Rock  New Jersey  and the Long Island Rail Road in the Hamptons on Long Island    13        Milton Berle   1908 2002  claimed  The Perils of Pauline  as his first film appearance  playing the character of a young boy  though this has never been independently verified   The serial did mark one of the early credits for the cinematographer  Arthur C  Miller   who was transferred to the project from the Pathé News department     Pathé established an American factory and studio facility in  Jersey City  New Jersey  in 1910  and also established the  Eclectic Film Company  as a subsidiary distribution company for both its American and European products   Although the Jersey City plant produced moderately popular comedies  dramas  and newsreels largely directed at the US market   Pauline  was the first American made Pathé effort to achieve worldwide success under the Eclectic banner     The final peril has Pauline sitting in a target boat as the Navy opens fire   The idea was also used in   To the Shores of Tripoli    1942  Fox     5       This successful serial was quickly followed by   The Exploits of Elaine    also starring White  Many imitations and  parodies  followed  heralding the first golden age of the American film serial     The title  The Perils of Pauline  was reused by  Universal Studios  for a  1933 sound serial  with a different plot  by  Paramount Pictures  as the  Betty Hutton  vehicle   The Perils of Pauline    1947   and by Universal again in 1967 as an  updated comedy      An abortive mixed media musical was planned to be based on the film  called  Who s That Girl    meant to be premiered by   The Boys from Syracuse   producer Richard York on Broadway in 1970  with a book written by Lewis Banchi and Milburn Smith  and with the planned participation of the songwriting duo  Ray Evans  and  Jay Livingston     14        The Perils of Pauline  is the prime example of what scholar  Ben Singer  has called the  serial queen  melodrama      15    It is remembered as a paradigmatic form of  damsel in distress  cinema  as well as for its extensive use of the  cliffhanger  technique in film serials     There has been a recent reassessment of Singer s model in the light of broader film forms    16       The film s style was later subject to nostalgic caricature in many forms  e g    Dudley Do Right     but the original heroine was neither as helpless as the caricatures  nor did the original film include the much parodied  tied to railroad tracks  or  tied to buzzsaw  scenarios which appeared in later films in this vein  Even the title phrase  Perils of  was often adopted by later serials  for example  in Universal s   Perils of the Secret Service      Perils of the Wild    and   Perils of the Yukon       The 1969–70 cartoon series   The Perils of Penelope Pitstop   was patterned after this serial  and included the plot point of the villain trying to eliminate the heroine so he can keep her inheritance     The   Thunderbirds   episode  Perils of Penelope  was inspired by  The Perils of Pauline
