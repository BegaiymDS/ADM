Edwin Middleton	Franco Cristaldi	W.C. Fields	W.C. Fields  Bud Ross  Marian West	Mutual Film Corporation	September 19, 1915 (U.S.)	15 min.	United States	Silent	Pool Sharks    also sometimes known as   The Pool Shark    is a  1915   silent   short film   The film is notable for being the film acting and writing debut of  W  C  Fields   and also features an early  stop motion animation  scene  during a game of  pool      Following a standard style of the era  the film is a  romantic   slapstick   comedy  short  Fields and his rival  played by  Bud Ross   vie over the affections of a woman  played by  Marian West    When their antics get out of hand at a picnic  it is decided that they should play a game of  pool   Both of them are pool sharks  and after the game turns into a farce  a fight ensues  Fields throws a ball at his rival  who ducks  The ball flies through the window and breaks a hanging  goldfish  bowl  soaking the woman they are fighting over and leaving goldfish in her hair  She storms into the pool hall and rejects both men     Fields helped make this film in  New York City   taking time off from the  Ziegfeld Follies   as publicity for the films pointed out  Vaudeville was Fields  primary vocation  and it would be nine years before he made his next known film  the 1924 film   Janice Meredith      Fields wore his obviously  fake moustache  in this film  as he did in all of his silent films  His character and mannerisms bear some resemblance to  Charlie Chaplin  s  although  the persona Fields later developed in his sound comedies is foreshadowed  during the picnic scene  when Field s character dumps a small child out of a chair so that he can steal it to get closer to the woman he is chasing     Fields was an expert  juggler   As with his early films   Pool Sharks  was intended to highlight a pool ball juggling act that featured in the actor s  vaudeville  show  In the final film  however  there is only a brief shot of Fields juggling several billiard balls  as his act was largely replaced with several poorly edited  stop motion  sequences depicting impossible shots  such as the balls jumping off the table and re racking themselves on the wall  Though innovative for the time  they are poorly animated  with obvious edits  and the animator s hand can actually be seen moving the balls along in one of the frames     Today   Pool Sharks  is best remembered as Fields  first film effort  Film historian  William K  Everson  critiques the film as an  auspicious debut   with Fields  routines and pacing already finely honed  It was one of two short films Fields made for a company called  Gaumont   distributed by Mutual  He and Ross made another short around the same time    His Lordship s Dilemma
