American  silent   short   Western film  written  produced  and directed by  Edwin S  Porter   a former  Edison Studios  cameraman  Actors in the movie included  Alfred C  Abadie    Broncho Billy Anderson  and  Justus D  Barnes   although there were no credits  Though a Western  it was filmed in  Milltown  New Jersey   The film was inspired by  Scott Marble  s 1896 stage play  and may also have been inspired by a 1900 train robbery perpetrated by  Butch Cassidy     2      3       At twelve minutes long   The Great Train Robbery  film is considered a milestone in film making  expanding on Porter s previous work   Life of an American Fireman    The film used a number of then unconventional  techniques   including  composite editing    on location  shooting  and frequent camera movement  The film is one of the earliest to use the technique of  cross cutting   in which two scenes are shown to be occurring simultaneously but in different locations  Some prints were also hand colored in certain scenes  Techniques used in  The Great Train Robbery  were inspired by those used in  Frank Mottershaw  s British film   A Daring Daylight Burglary    released earlier in the year    4    Film historians now largely consider  The Great Train Robbery  to be the first American  action film  and the first Western film with a  recognizable form     5      6       In 1990   The Great Train Robbery  was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant      The film opens with two bandits breaking into a railroad telegraph office  where they force the operator at gunpoint to have a train stopped and to transmit orders for the engineer to fill the  locomotive  s  tender  at the station s water tank  They then knock the operator out and tie him up  As the train stops it is boarded by the bandits‍—‌now four  Two bandits enter an  express car   kill a messenger and open a box of valuables with dynamite  the others kill the  fireman  and force the  engineer  to halt the train and disconnect the locomotive  The bandits then force the passengers off the train and rifle them for their belongings  One passenger tries to escape but is instantly shot down  Carrying their loot  the bandits escape in the locomotive  later stopping in a valley where their horses had been left     Meanwhile  back in the telegraph office  the bound operator awakens  but he collapses again  His daughter arrives bringing him his meal and cuts him free  and restores him to consciousness by dousing him with water     There is some  comic relief  at a dance hall  where an Eastern stranger is forced to dance while the locals fire at his feet  The door suddenly opens and the telegraph operator rushes in to tell them of the robbery  The men quickly form a posse  which overtakes the bandits  and in a final shootout kills them all and recovers the stolen mail     An additional scene of the film presents a medium  close up  of the leader of the bandits  played by  Justus D  Barnes   who empties his pistol  point blank  directly into the camera  The scene is not directly related to anything in the main narrative  and is described as  Realism  by the accompanying letter from  Edison Manufacturing     7    Although it is usually placed at the end  Porter stated that the scene could also appear at the beginning of the film    8       The media historian  James Chapman  observed that the sequence may have inspired the  gun barrel sequence  from the  James Bond films     9       Porter s film was shot at the Edison studios in New York City  on location in New Jersey at the  South Mountain Reservation   part of the modern  Essex County Park system   as well as along the  Delaware  Lackawanna  and Western Railroad   Filmed during November 1903  the picture was advertised as available for sale to distributors in December of that same year    11       Though shot in  black and white   certain sections of print were  hand colored   for example  the pink and orange vault explosion  the colored dresses in the dance hall sequence  and the green shirt in the film s final shot     3       Porter  who had been making and projecting films for Edison since 1896  attempted to incorporate the latest trends in film editing and photography in  The Great Train Robbery   Most films of the time sought to replicate the perspective of someone viewing a play from the best seats in a theater  As a result  scenes were almost exclusively shot directly and at eye level with a static camera  Porter s camerawork was much more dynamic and fluid  riding on the top of a train and panning through a forest  This gave the film a much more immersive and realistic feel than audiences were accustomed to  Porter also incorporated stop motion photography  matte shots  and painted in coloring to make the film    12        The Great Train Robbery  had its official debut at Huber s Museum in New York City before being exhibited at eleven theaters elsewhere in the city    13    In advertising for the film  Edison agents touted the film as     absolutely the superior of any moving picture ever made    14    as well as a     faithful imitation of the genuine  Hold Ups  made famous by various outlaw bands in the far West       14      8       The film s budget was an estimated    150  equal to  4183 today    1    Upon its release   The Great Train Robbery  became a massive success and is considered one of the first Western films    15    It is also considered one of the first  blockbusters  and was one of the most popular films of the silent era until the release of   The Birth of a Nation   in 1915    15       The success of  The Great Train Robbery  inspired several similar films  The first  premiering less than a year later  in August 1904  was a  remake  of the same name directed by  Siegmund Lubin     16      17    It has been called the first film remake   18     at the time  copyright protection for motion pictures was legally murky and illegally copied prints and unauthorized remakes abounded  It wasn t until the  1912 Townsend Amendment  to the  Copyright Act of 1909  that motion pictures were specifically defined as a protected work     19       The film also inspired numerous imitators  including   The Bold Bank Robbery    1904  also produced by Lubin  and  The Hold Up Of The Rocky Mountain Express   1906   Porter himself tried to re capture his previous success with  The Life of an American Cowboy   1906    20    and a parody of  The Great Train Robbery  titled   The Little Train Robbery    1905   with an all child cast  in which a larger gang of bandits holds up a mini train to steal their dolls and candy
