Land of the War Canoes    is a  1914   silent film  fictionalizing the world of the  Kwakwaka wakw  peoples of the  Queen Charlotte Strait  region of the  Central Coast of British Columbia   Canada  written and directed by  Edward S  Curtis  and acted entirely by Kwakwaka wakw native people    1       The film was selected in 1999 for preservation in the US  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  and aesthetically significant     2    It was the first feature length film whose cast was composed entirely of Native North Americans  the second  eight years later  was  Robert Flaherty  s   Nanook of the North      1    Most of the film was shot on the Deer Island near  Fort Rupert   British Columbia    3    It was the first feature film made in British Columbia  and is the oldest surviving feature film made in Canada    4       Curtis had earlier experimented with multimedia  In 1911 he created a stage show with slides  a lecture  and live musical accompaniment  called   The Indian Picture Opera    He used  stereopticon  projectors  where two projectors dissolved back and forth between images  This was his prelude to entering the motion picture era    3       The film opened in  New York City  and  Seattle  Washington  in December 1914  with live performances of a score by  John J  Braham   Braham had access to  wax cylinder  recordings of Kwakwaka wakw music  and the promotional campaign at the time suggested that his score was based on these  in fact  there were few snatches of Kwakwaka wakw music in the score  Curtis hoped the film would be successful enough to fund the completion of   The North American Indian    a multi volume history of every indigenous tribe on the continent he had been working on since 1906    3    Although critically praised  the film was a commercial failure    5    Curtis spent approximately  75 000 to make the film  but it only earned  3 269 18 after a year in theaters  He was so disappointed with the film s financial performance that he sold all the rights to the film to the  New York Museum of Natural History  in 1919 or 1920  When the museum lost Curtis s donated material  the film was considered lost until 1947    3       A single damaged  incomplete print of the film was salvaged from a dumpster by film collector Hugo Zeiter of Danville Illinois and donated to  Chicago  s  Field Museum of Natural History  in 1947    3     Bill Holm  and  George Quimby  obtained a 16mm copy in 1965 and completed a re edited version of the film in 1974    3    having added a soundtrack by Kwakwaka wakw musicians  and released the result as  In the Land of the War Canoes   Independently  some other damaged clips from the film made their way to the  UCLA Film and Television Archive   The score had been filed at the library of the  Getty Research Institute   but without a title that tied it to the film    6    The 2008 restoration brought together these materials    5     Milestone Films  has announced plans to release a restored  One Hundredth Anniversary  DVD of the film with the original score in 2014    7        In the Land of the Head Hunters  has often been discussed as a flawed  documentary film   The film combines many accurate representations of aspects of Kwakwaka wakw culture  art  and technology from the era in which it was made with a melodramatic plot based on practices that either dated from long before the first contact of the Kwakwaka wakw with people of European descent or were entirely fictional  Curtis appears never to have specifically presented the film as a documentary  but he also never specifically called it a work of fiction    3      5       Some aspects of the film do have documentary accuracy  the artwork  the ceremonial dances  the clothing  the architecture of the buildings  and the construction of the  dugout   or a  war canoe  reflected Kwakwaka wakw culture  Other aspects of the film were based on the Kwakwaka wakw s orally transmitted traditions or on aspects of other neighboring cultures  The film also accurately portrays Kwakwaka wakw rituals that were  at the time  prohibited by Canada s  potlatch  prohibition  enacted in 1884 and not rescinded until 1951    5       However  as is noted by the producers who supervised the centennial restoration of the film     The most sensational elements of the film—the head hunting  sorcery  and handling of human remains—reflect much earlier practices that had been long abandoned  but which became central elements in Curtis s spectacularized tale  And some activities were never part of Kwakwaka’wakw culture  For example  Curtis borrowed the whaling practices  and the rented whale   from neighboring groups for what seem to be purely dramatic and cinematic reasons    8       The following plot synopsis was published in conjunction with a 1915 showing of the film at  Carnegie Hall      To gain power from the  spirit forces   Motana  a great chief s son  goes on a vigil journey  But though the tribal law forbids the thought of woman during the fasting  his dreams are ever of Naida  her face appearing in the coilng smoke of the prayer fire he builds high upon a mountain peak  To forfend the anger of the spirits he must pass a stronger ordeal  He sleeps upon the Island of the Dead  then hunts and kills the  whale   and raids the clustered  sea lion  rookeries  a whole day s paddle out to sea     Naida is wooed and won by Motana  and splendid is the wooing  But Naida  with her  dowry   is coveted by the Sorcerer  He is evil  old and ugly  Waket  Naida s father fears the baleful  medicine  of the Sorcerer  and also stands in dread of the Sorcerer s brother  who is Yaklus   the short life bringer   and the head hunting scourge of all the coast  Waket promises Naida to the Sorcerer  So ensues war between the two factions     Motana and his father  Kenada  and their clan resolve to rid the region of the head hunters  In their great canoes they attack the village of the Sorcerer and Yaklus  The Sorcerer s head they bring to prove his death to those who believed him  deathless   But Yaklus escapes  After the wedding of Motana and Naida  with pomp of primitive pageantry  and dancing and feasting  in which the throngs of two great totem villages take part  Yaklus attacks and burns Motana s village  Motana is left for dead  Naida is carried away into captivity  Wild is the reveling that follows at the village of Yaklus  The beauty of Naida s dancing saves her life  Naida s slave boy  a fellow captive  escapes  His message brings Motana  who rescues Naida by stealth  The raging Yaklus pursues  Motana  hard pressed  dares the waters of the surging gorge of Hyal  His canoe flies through  but Yaklus is overwhelmed and drowned    9
