William Garwood  Marguerite Snow	Motion Picture Distributors and Sales Company	January 6, 1911	1 reel	United States	Silent English  intertitles	Baseball and Bloomers    also known as   Baseball in Bloomers    is a 1911 American  silent   short  sports film produced by the  Thanhouser Company   The film stars  William Garwood  and is the debut of  Marguerite Snow   The film focuses on a  female seminary  which organizes a baseball club and challenges another school to a game  The boys accept to the game with amusement and find that the women are not good at baseball  Two  Harvard University  baseball stars join the ranks of the girls in disguise and defeat the boys team  The script may have been written by  Lloyd Lonergan  and the film may have been directed by  Barry O Neil  or  Lucius J  Henderson   The film was released on January 6  1911 and it received positive reviews  The film is presumed  lost      Though the film is presumed  lost   a synopsis survives in   The Moving Picture World   from January 7  1911  It states   Miss Street s Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils  The young athletes  not content with basketball and tennis  aspire to shine in the great American game  and organize a baseball club  They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College  which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something  When the challenge is received  the boys are first angry  then amused  They decide to accept it  to have fun with the girls  The young women  after some practice  realize that their team  while it may be pretty to look at  is of little real use on the diamond  And the prospect makes them weep  Fortunately for the girls  Jack  the brother of the president  arrives from  Harvard   His chum  Jim  is with him  These two young men are baseball stars themselves  and when they are told of the predicament of the girls  they goodnaturedly offer to help them out  The university men disguise themselves as girls  act as battery for the young women  and the college boys  who had looked for a laughable victory  are mowed down  inning after inning  because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim  The other members of the  girl  team have nothing to do except look pretty  When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished  the girls reward their battery with one kiss   only one   from each of the other seven players     1       The writer of the scenario was most likely  Lloyd Lonergan   He was an experienced newspaperman employed by   The New York Evening World   while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions    2    The film director may have been  Barry O Neil  or  Lucius J  Henderson   The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions though cameramen employed by the company during this era included  Blair Smith    Alfred H  Moses  Jr   and  Carl Louis Gregory     3      4    The other cast credits are unknown  but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary    3    In late 1910  the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films  The list includes  G W  Abbe    Justus D  Barnes    Frank H  Crane    Irene Crane    Marie Eline    Violet Heming    Martin J  Faust    Thomas Fortune    George Middleton    Grace Moore    John W  Noble    Anna Rosemond   and  Mrs  George Walters     5       This film is important for being the debut of Marguerite Snow  who would become one of the most important actresses for the company  In an interview by Johnson Briscoe  Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one  A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made  There at the studio   Edwin Thanhouser  asked her if she wanted to be in the film  Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene  Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home  A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage    6    Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company    The Baseball Bug      7       The single reel comedy  approximately 1 000 feet long  was released on January 6  1911    1    The film had a wide national release  advertising theaters are known in  Indiana     8     North Carolina     9     South Dakota     10     Iowa     11     Pennsylvania     12    and  Texas     13    In  Arizona   the film would be advertised by one theatre as  Baseball Bloomers  and it appears to also have been the case in another  Kansas  theater    14      15    The film would also be shown in  Hawaii  in August 1912    16         The New York Dramatic Mirror   gave a brief summary and review of the film and gave minor praise for the production  The reviewer wrote   The details of this comedy are well worked out  and it is good for a portion of genuine laughs  The girls of Miss Street s Seminary become so elated over their success in the gymnasium that they feel impelled to branch out  and accordingly they challenge the boys of Adair College to a game of ball  At the last moment the girls feel like backing out  when two of Cornell s star baseball players arrive in town  They agree to pitch and catch for the girls  who give them bloomers and rats from their hair for disguise  At the eighth inning the score was 0 to 0  By the ninth it was 0 to 2  in favor of Miss Street s Seminary for Girls  The nine girls then showed their gratitude by giving the pitcher and catcher a round of kisses  while the Adair College boys stood off at a respectful distance  The actors were equal to the occasion     6      The Billboard   affirmed by stating   Thanhouser producers have again placed a picture of originality on the market in  Baseball and Bloomers   It is a farce pure and simple  but it offers many laughable situations  The acting is generally good  but in a few instances scenes were overacted     1
