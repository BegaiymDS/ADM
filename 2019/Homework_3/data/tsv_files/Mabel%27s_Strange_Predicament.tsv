 Charles Chaplin Chester Conklin Alice Davenport Harry McCoy Hank Mann Al St. John"	H.F. Koenekamp  [1]	Keystone Studios	February 9, 1914  ( 1914-02-09 )	17 minutes	United States	Silent film English (Original titles)	Mabel s Strange Predicament   is a 1914 American film starring  Mabel Normand  and  Charles Chaplin   notable for being the first film for which Chaplin donned  The Tramp  costume    1       In a hotel lobby a heavily drunk  tramp  runs into an elegant lady  Mabel  who gets tied up in her dog s leash  and falls down  He later runs into her in the hotel corridor  locked out of her room  They run through various rooms  Mabel ends up in the room of an elderly husband where she hides under the bed  Enter the jealous wife  who soon attacks Mabel  her husband  and Mabel s lover  not to mention the staggeringly drunken tramp     A reviewer for Exhibitors  Mail saw the genius of Chaplin in just his third film and predicted great things for the former English stage comedian   He wrote   The Keystone Company never made a better contract than when they signed on Chas  Chaplin  the Karno performer   It is not every variety artiste who possesses the ability to act before the camera   Chaplin not only shows that talent  he shows it in a degree which raises him at once to the status of star performer   We do not often indulge in prophecy  but we do not think we are taking a great risk in prophesying that in six months Chaplin will rank as one of the most popular screen performers in the world   Certainly there has never been before quite so successful a first appearance       The Tramp  was first presented to the public in Chaplin s second film   Kid Auto Races at Venice    released February 7  1914  though  Mabel s Strange Predicament   his third film in order of release   released February 9  1914  was produced a few days before  It was for this film that Chaplin first conceived of and played the Tramp  As Chaplin recalled in his  autobiography      I had no idea what makeup to put on  I did not like my get up as the press reporter  in  Making a Living    However on the way to the wardrobe I thought I would dress in baggy pants  big shoes  a cane and a derby hat  I wanted everything to be a contradiction  the pants baggy  the coat tight  the hat small and the shoes large  I was undecided whether to look old or young  but remembering Sennett had expected me to be a much older man  I added a small mustache  which I reasoned  would add age without hiding my expression  I had no idea of the character  But the moment I was dressed  the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was  I began to know him  and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born     Mabel s Strange Predicament  is one of more than a dozen early films that writer director comedian Mabel Normand made with Chaplin  Normand  who had written and directed films before Chaplin  mentored the young comedian  Chaplin s Tramp is shown swigging from a flask toward the beginning of the film and subsequently becoming so drunk that he staggers when he walks and falls down repeatedly near the end  His portrayal of drunkenness remains convincingly realistic  The Tramp also keeps his derby cocked throughout the proceedings  a touch that Chaplin abandoned later in his career
