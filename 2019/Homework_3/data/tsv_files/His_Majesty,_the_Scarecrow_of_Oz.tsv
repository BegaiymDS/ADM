a 1914 American silent fantasy adventure film directed by  J  Farrell MacDonald  and written and produced by  L  Frank Baum   It stars  Violet MacMillan    Frank Moore    Vivian Reed   Todd Wright   Pierre Couderc    Raymond Russell   and  Fred Woodward      The film had a troubled distribution history  it opened on October 14  1914  to little success  though it was received as well above average fare by critics of the time    1    Early in 1915  it was reissued under the title   The New Wizard of Oz   and was slightly more successful     The film is loosely based on Baum s book   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz    but in the screenplay Baum introduced many new characters and a large new story that later became the basis for the 1915 book   The Scarecrow of Oz    Similar to  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz   the Scarecrow s origin is revealed  although his life is now attributed to  the Spirit of the Corn   who appears as a conventional  Hollywood  depiction of a  Native American   The Tin Woodman is found rusted stiff and oiled  but he is already Emperor of the Winkies  Dorothy is a slave to  Mombi   Wells  who looks like  W W  Denslow  s depiction of the Wicked Witch of the West  The Cowardly Lion is encountered only briefly  and battles The Lonesome Zoop  a character who appears in all three films  All of the animal roles are attributed to  Fred Woodward   though too many appear in the same shot at once for him to have played them all      citation needed         King Krewl   Raymond Russell   is a cruel dictator in the  Emerald City  in the  Land of Oz   He wishes to marry his daughter  Princess Gloria  Vivian Reed   to an old courtier named Googly Goo  Arthur Smollett   but she is in love with Pon  the  Gardener  s boy  Todd Wright   Krewl employs the Wicked Witch named  Mombi   Mai Wells   to freeze the heart of Gloria so she will not love Pon any longer  This she does by pulling out her heart  which looks somewhere between a valentine and a bland representation of a heart without any vessels  and coating it with ice  Meanwhile  a lost little girl from  Kansas  named  Dorothy Gale   Violet MacMillan   is captured by Mombi and imprisoned in her castle  However  Dorothy runs away with the now heartless Gloria  accompanied by Pon and eventually meet the Scarecrow   Frank Moore    Mombi catches up with the travelers and removes the Scarecrow s stuffing  but Dorothy and Pon are able to re stuff him  Gloria abandons them and wanders off     They meet the lost little boy   Button Bright   Mildred Harris   The party travels to the  Winkie Country  next and arrives at the Tin Castle of the  Tin Woodman   Pierre Couderc   who has rusted solid   The Tin Woodman resides in a Tin Castle in later Oz novels  beginning in   The Emerald City of Oz      1910   Mombi reaches the Tin Castle  and the Tin Woodman chops off her head  however  this merely slows her down as she hunts for it and places it back on    The Wicked Witch of the East  in   The Tin Woodman of Oz   is later described as having done a similar thing to him when he was still human   Having replaced her head  Mombi encounters Pon and turns him into a  kangaroo      Dorothy  Button Bright  the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman escape from Mombi by crossing a river on a raft  As in the original novel   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz    1900   the Scarecrow s barge pole gets stuck in the river bed and leaves him stranded  until he is rescued by a bird  At one point in this sequence  the Scarecrow slides down the pole into the river  resulting a brief  underwater  sequence featuring puppet fish and a  mermaid   throughout  the Scarecrow makes asides to the camera  mostly without  intertitles    At another point  the frozen Gloria even makes a malevolent stare directly into the camera      The party encounters the  Wizard   J  Charles Haydon   who tricks Mombi by letting the group hide in the Red Wagon  pulled by the sawhorse  when Mombi attempts to follow them  the group escape out the back of the wagon  The four companions meet the  Cowardly Lion   who joins them  The Wizard traps Mombi in a container of  Preserved Sandwitches  and paints out the  sand  and the plural  carrying her away in his pocket  The Scarecrow  taking a barrage of arrows  tosses Krewl s soldiers over the battlements to deal with the Cowardly Lion  who cannot climb the rope ladder over the city wall  With the support of the people  the Scarecrow is easily able to depose King Krewl  The Wizard releases Mombi  and compels her to restore Pon to his normal form and unfreeze Gloria s heart     The opening reel was lost for many years  While it was eventually recovered  it did not contain the opening titles   Dick Martin  s titles  designed in the 1960s  continued to be used  which falsely stated that Baum was the director of the film  misspelled Mai Wells  name  and left out Smollett s credit entirely     The film is currently in need of restoration  including framing and color correction  Video prints are notoriously bright  particularly for Mombi s decapitation sequence  The framing may no longer be correctable  because the area used for the soundtrack in contemporary films was part of the picture area at the time  though it is a noticeable defect in contemporary presentations of the film  Prints that have not been re struck in this cropping manner may no longer exist      citation needed
