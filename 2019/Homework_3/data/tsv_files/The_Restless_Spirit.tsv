shows the futility of conquest when he cannot conquer his own community  He returns and eventually becomes respected by the community that once ridiculed him  The film makes use of numerous dissolves which were technically difficult to execute  and reportedly sent the cameraman to the hospital due to stress  The film may have been the last unbilled appearance by  Lon Chaney   and was released on October 27  1913 by  Universal Film Manufacturing Company  under the Victor label  The film is presumed  lost      The film begins with the Dreamer  a restless and disappointed dreamer who has a wife and child  He gazes at his hands and dreams of becoming a conqueror  but laments that no chance comes to him and continues to dream  The Dreamer becomes the subject of ridicule and his wife becomes the subject of pity by the community  The Dreamer decides enter the world of men and abandons his wife leaving her to seek refuge in her father  Her father wishes for her to marry a wealthy gentleman

dreamer the futility of conquering worlds unknown when he cannot conquer his own small corner of the world    1    The Dreamer sees himself in the roles of great conquerors  but each vision ends with death  The Dreamer s wife has been kicked out for refusing to marry the stranger  and is reunited with the Dreamer on the edge of the desert  The stranger is sent out into the desert and the Dreamer and his wife return to the town  In time  the Dreamer becomes respected by the community    2       The groundwork for  The Restless Spirit  began when  Allan Dwan  visited  Universal  s offices in  New York City  in late July 1913  Frederic Lombardi believes that it was during this meeting that  Carl Laemmle  offered Dwan s colleagues double their pay from  Flying A  if they would come to Universal  In the following weeks   J  Warren Kerrigan  came to Universal and the two would work together in the production of  The Restless Spirit   Dwan credits the idea to adapt and produce a film on  Thomas Gray    s   Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard   as a betting challenge  Dwan also claimed to have studied Gray s poem and dream about the production before accepting the challenge  Frederic Lombardi  author of  Allan Dwan and the Rise and Decline of the Hollywood Studios   writes that Dwan may have been emboldened after the production of the   Pickett Guard   and the lack of structure in Gray s poem  Since the poem had no  real story   Dwan could formulate his own allegorical plot    5    Dwan was also able to convince his employers that the work would be a box office success and intended to use the film a prestigious multi role vehicle for Kerrigan s debut at Universal    5    Lombardi writes that Dwan was subject to produce overtly artistic films  but these tendencies were kept in check by Dwan s more practical inclinations    5       The film s ethereal aspects and double exposures were performed in the camera because the ability to create the effects in lab did not yet exist  Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film  each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined  Lombardi notes that the cinematographer  Walter Pritchard  was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said he was one of the company s oldest men  Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production    5    In   The Parade s Gone By    Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done  Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots    6    This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney    5    The discovery of Lon Chaney s role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head  Chaney wrote  This is me just below the X sign  Here I am a Russian Prince   on the back of the still    2    The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from  The Restless Spirit  because it also appears on the cover of  The Universal Weekly  for October 23  1913    7    The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman  which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film    2       On September 6  1913   Motography  reported that  J  Warren Kerrigan  would star in the upcoming picture known as  A Restless Spirit  with a reference to Kerrigan s transfer to Universal    8    Alternate names for the film such as  His Restless Spirit    9    and  A Restless Spirit     10       It is unknown if the film was initially planned or if it was mere assumption  but it was reported that it would be a two reel production in September 1913    9      11    Newspaper accounts change to reference the film as having three reels by October 3  1913    12    As details spread in the newspaper  the film s working title continued to be referenced as  A Restless Spirit  in various papers    13    Newspaper references began to reference the final title on October 24  1913    14    The film was released on October 27  1913 by  Universal Film Manufacturing Company  under the Victor label    15       With the film s release on October 27  it was of minor note that the Alcazar of  Atlanta  Georgia  would show the film until November 1  1913    16    The film would be a special for the week at the Hippodrome in  Leavenworth  Kansas     17    Some theaters  such as the Alamo of  El Paso  Texas  would only show the film for a single day    18    The Unique theater  also of El Paso  would show the film on October 29 due to a  slip up  with Universal s New York office  The advertisement would also mention Kerrigan s popularity in the area in otherwise apparent contrast to the Alamo s single day run    18      19    Another advertisement noted the film s artistry and that it is one of the best three reel films released  but the film would play for only a single day    20    The film received play in various theaters until at least July 1914    21       Advertisements would state the films artistry or that it was one of the best three reel films released    20    Lombardi cites a single review from   The Moving Picture World   in his text and suggests that other reviews may have been more tepid  but the result was that Dwan would not produce any more films of  such experimental nature  at Universal    5    The film is now considered to be  lost     22    It is unknown when the film was lost  but if it was in Universal s vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal s silent era films in 1948    23       Pauline Bush s role has been the subject of some dispute  but a contemporary account also states her role as the wife    3    William Worthington s role was also noted by a later contemporary account    4
