Otis Turner  (unconfirmed)	William Selig	Otis Turner (unconfirmed)	The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  by  L. Frank Baum	Bebe Daniels	Selig Polyscope Company	March 24, 1910  ( 1910-03-24 )	13 mins.	United States	Silent film English intertitles	The Wonderful Wizard of Oz   is a 1910 American  silent   fantasy film  and the earliest surviving film version of  L  Frank Baum  s 1900 novel   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz    made by the  Selig Polyscope Company  without Baum s direct input  It was created to fulfill a contractual obligation associated with Baum s  personal bankruptcy  caused by   The Fairylogue and Radio Plays    from which it was once thought to have been derived   It was partly based on the 1902 stage musical   The Wizard of Oz    though much of the film deals with the  Wicked Witch of the West   who does not appear in the musical     In  Kansas    Dorothy  and Imogene the cow are chased by Hank the mule  and the farmhands draw their muskets at the beast  Dorothy runs off to their field and discovers that the family scarecrow is alive  The Scarecrow begins to notice a  storm  building up and hurries the Mule  the Cow  Toto and Dorothy behind a haystack  A  tornado  appears overhead and carries the haystack away  thus letting it fall into the Land of Oz    1       In Oz  The Wizard in the  Emerald City  declares that he is retiring from being the ruler and he will be crowning a new leader  The wicked witch Momba appears and attacks the wizard and the paper disappears  Meanwhile  Dorothy is playing with Toto  while being stalked by the  Cowardly Lion   The good witch  Glinda  decides to turn Toto into a real protector that can fight off large predators  While Toto befriends the lion  the Scarecrow finds the wizard s paper on a tree    1       The traveler s continue onward and find the  Tin Woodsman   They oil him and find Eureka the cat   When they enter a forest  Momba the Witch flies out the window as her soldiers come out of the cottage  they are all captured and led into the witch s jail house  Dorthy splashes water on Momba and kills her  After defeating the witch  the travelers arrive at the  Emerald City  for the retirement party of the Wizard  who names the Scarecrow king and leaves in a balloon    1       The credits to this film are lost  and the identity of the director and actors are disputed      by whom          There is no definitive proof who is in the cast  or who directed the film    Otis Turner  may have directed the film  but  Mark Evan Swartz  points out that it is highly unlikely that both  Otis Turner  and  Bebe Daniels  worked on the film  as they were in different parts of the country at the time  Turner in Chicago  Daniels in California   and neither had a strong impetus for travel   Dorothy does resemble contemporary photos of Daniels  which would make Turner s direction improbable   Michael Patrick Hearn  disputes this  and has found ample evidence that both were in California at the time   At any rate  that Baum knew of Turner is confirmed by his spoofery of an  Otis Werner  in his   Aunt Jane s Nieces Out West    a fictional account inspired by his optimism as an  independent filmmaker      Other reported cast members include  Hobart Bosworth    Robert Z  Leonard    Eugenie Besserer    Winifred Greenwood    Lillian Leighton   Olive Cox  Marcia Moore  and Alvin Wycoff  Swartz suggests Bosworth was the Scarecrow and Leonard the Tin Woodman  but photographs of the actors make this appear unlikely and suggest that Bosworth was the Wizard and Leonard the Scarecrow  Based on photographs  and assuming the cast list is correct  it appears that Cox is  Glinda  and Leighton is the servant who pulls out a list of Union rules  Besserer is most likely Momba  and Greenwood likely to be Aunt Em  There is quite a large cast before the camera  and it is unlikely that they will all ever be identified   Michael Patrick Hearn  emphasizes that this cast list is not contemporary with the film and may have no basis in fact     The character Imogene the Cow did not appear in the novel  The cow was used as a replacement for Toto the dog in the stage musical  Many of the costumes and much of the make up in this film  though notably  not of the  Tin Woodman   resemble those used in the 1902 Broadway musical   The Wizard of Oz     None of the songs in the stage show  however  were used in the later  MGM film  which has become so famous    As is clear from the plot descriptions below  the presence of Eureka the kitten is drawn from the commingling of material from  The Marvelous Land of Oz  and  Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz   Eureka appears in the latter novel     Long thought to be culled from footage from   The Fairylogue and Radio Plays    a  feature length   stage  and film show created and presented by Baum in 1908   this was proven not to be the case when the film was recovered   Although the only known  Fairylogue  film footage has decomposed  and the interactive nature of the presentation makes the discovery of another print unlikely   the slides  script  and production stills are available  and many have been reprinted in books and magazines  and clearly from another production  which emphasized material from   Ozma of Oz   that the descriptions of the Selig films imply was ignored   This film  and its sequels  were created in the wake of Baum s loss of the rights to  The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  and temporary licensing rights on  The Marvelous Land of Oz  and  John Dough and the Cherub       The Wonderful Wizard of Oz  was later followed by the sequels   Dorothy and the Scarecrow in Oz    The Land of Oz   and  John Dough and the Cherub   all 1910 and are all considered to be  lost films   Other Oz silent films include   The Patchwork Girl of Oz      The Magic Cloak of Oz    and   His Majesty  the Scarecrow of Oz    all released in 1914  and  The Wizard of Oz   1925     2       The Selig Polyscope sequels are known only from their catalog descriptions  derived from press releases printed in   The Moving Picture World       Dorothy and the Scarecrow are now in the Emerald City  They have become friendly with the Wizard  and together with the woodman  the cowardly lion  and several new creations equally delightful  they journey through Oz    the earthquake    and into the glass city  The Scarecrow is elated to think he is going to get his brains at last and be like other men are  the Tin Woodman is bent upon getting a heart  and the cowardly lion pleads with the great Oz for courage  All these are granted by his Highness  Dorothy picks the princess     The Dangerous Mangaboos     Into the black pit  and out again  We then see Jim  the cab horse  and myriads of pleasant surprises that hold and fascinate    3      The Emerald City in all its splendor with all the familiar characters so dear to the hearts of children   Little Dorothy  the scarecrow  the woodman  the cowardly lion  and the wizard continuing on their triumphal entry to the mystic city  adding new characters  new situations  and scintillating comedy  Dorothy  who has so won her way into the good graces of lovers of fairy folk  finds new encounters in the rebellion army of  General Jinger   sic  showing myriads of Leith soldiers in glittering apparel forming one surprise after the other  until the whole resolves itself into a spectacle worthy of the best artists in picturedom  Those who have followed the two preceding pictures of this great subject cannot but appreciate  The Land of Oz   the crowning effort of the Oz series    4      No description of this film was given  but it does mention the name  It was unlikely to be considered a direct sequel  but is probably based on another  L  Frank Baum  novel    John Dough and the Cherub       One of the films in the 3 disc boxed DVD set called  More Treasures from American Film Archives   2004   compiled by the  National Film Preservation Foundation  from 5 American film archives  This film is preserved by  George Eastman House   has a running time of 13 minutes and an added piano score adapted from  Paul Tietjens  s music from the  1902 stage play  and performed by  Martin Marks    It is also included in the 3 disc edition of  the 1939 film version   On this edition  John Thomas performs a compilation of Oz related music by  Louis F  Gottschalk
