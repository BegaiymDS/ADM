William S  Hart  and  Clara Williams    Directed by  Charles Swickard   William S  Hart and Clifford Smith  and produced by  Thomas H  Ince   the  screenplay  was written by  C  Gardner Sullivan       Hell s Hinges  has been selected for preservation in the  National Film Registry   and is considered by some to be one of the finest silent  Westerns       Hell s Hinges  tells the story of a weak willed minister  Rev  Bob Henley  played by Standing   who comes to a wild and debauched frontier town with his sister  Faith  played by Williams   The owner of the saloon  Silk Miller  played by Hollingsworth   and his accomplices sense trouble and encourage the local rowdies to disrupt the attempts to evangelize the community  Hard bitten gunman Blaze Tracy  played by Hart   the most dangerous man around  is  however  won over by the sincerity of Faith  He intervenes to expel the rowdies from the newly built church     Silk adopts a new approach  He encourages the dance hall girl  Dolly  played by Glaum   to seduce Rev  Henley  She gets him drunk  and he spends the night in her room  The following morning the whole town learns of his fall from grace  Blaze rides out to find a doctor for the now near demented minister     The disgraced minister  having rapidly descended into alcoholism  is goaded into helping the rowdy element to burn down the church  The church goers try to defend the church  and a gunfight erupts in which the minister is killed and the church set ablaze  Blaze returns too late to stop the destruction  In revenge  Blaze kills Silk and burns down the whole town  beginning with the saloon  He and Faith leave to start a new life     The production companies were Kay Bee Pictures and New York Motion Picture     When  Hell s Hinges  was released  the reception of the film among New York critics was so positive that the producer bought space in newspapers around the country to reprint the reviews    1     The following are excerpts from those reviews     Grace Kingsley of the  Los Angeles Times  gave the actors high marks   She credited Hart with doing his  usual excellent work  and found Glaum to be  a really fascinating vampire     2     Kingsley paid special note to Standing s performance as the reverend  calling it  one of the most subtle  but at the same time of the most sincere bits of film acting of his entire career   a performance exhibiting  intelligence and imagination     in the very highest degree     2     Kingsley found the film to be  marvelously well done  but took exception to the would be folksy western dialect in the title cards     C  Gardner Sullivan appears to have written  Hell s Hinges  for the purpose of allowing us to look our fill on fire and fights   Certain it is the thing is marvelously well done   There is a burning dance hall with men and women entrapped  which fairly makes you gasp  and there is a  beau oo tiful  free for all fight between the sheep and the goats of  Hell s Hinges    All this is lovely enough in its way to make for forgiveness of the dialect of the subtitles  a dialect which  never was on land or sea     2      The title cards includes lines such as  When women like her say there is a God  there is one  and he sure must be worth trailin  with      The publication   Moving Picture World   gave the film as a whole a positive review   Brilliant in subtitle  strong in treatment with occasional notes of true pathos  the marks of creative ability and sure craftmanship are there       the cast is without flaw     3      The publication further noted that Ince  is at his best when holding close to revelations of the human mind and heart     3       In September 1994   Hell s Hinges  experienced a revival following a screening at the Film Center of the School of the Chicago Art Institute    4     At the time  the  Chicago Tribune  s movie critic  Michael Wilmington  called  Hell s Hinges   Hart s acknowledged masterpiece    perhaps the finest movie Western made before  John Ford  s 1939   Stagecoach     and  as emotionally powerful as any American film of the teens  except for the masterpieces of  D W  Griffith  and  Erich Von Stroheim      4       Two months after the showing in Chicago and Wilmington s review  the film was selected for preservation in the United States  National Film Registry  by the  Library of Congress  as being  culturally  historically  or aesthetically significant     5       In 1997    Film Comment   published a review calling  Hell s Hinges  a  classic of its kind  and arguing that  to dismiss it casually as a western would be a mistake  for it more resembles   The Atonement of Gosta Berling   than it does   Riders of the Purple Sage      6     The reviewer gave particular praise to Hart s directorial skill     The camera placement here  the simple yet effective symbolism  and the flair for spectacle as in the brilliantly handled mob scenes where all of  Inceville  goes up in smoke  the real  feel  of the old  dusty  unglamorised West  all should have earned Hart a reputation as one of the great directors      For the most part   Hell s Hinges  offers highpowered drama rather than traditional western action      Fine camerawork utilising long panoramic shots  excellent cutting and a sure control over the masses of extras fuse this into an episode of astonishing vigor  Hart  his assistant Cliff Smith  his writer Gardner Sullivan and cameraman Joe August were one of the sturdiest  and least appreciated  teams of craftsmen the cinema ever produced    6      The film was given a centenary screening at the  Museum of Modern Art  in January 2016    7    In a capsule review for the occasion   The New Yorker  s  Richard Brody  praised the film for its uncommon intensity   The images are as direct and bare as the characters  emotions  and the harsh drama builds to a mad  apocalyptic climax of crime and revenge     7       In 2009  the band Caledonia Mission wrote a song for   Esopus   magazine inspired by the movie  The song is named  The Ballad of Blaze Tracy     8
