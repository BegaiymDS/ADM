# Homework Delivery 

In order to deliver every Homework, you __MUST__ complete __ALL__ the following steps. 

#### Group

The __entire group__ is responsible for these 2 steps. If at least one of this steps is not performed, we'll assume that the whole group will not deliver the homework.

1) Fill the form where you declare your group's Github repository. You can find it in the [`README.md`] file of each single homework. This must be done __as soon as possible__, and of course __BEFORE__ the deadline of the given homework. __N.b.__: we need __only one__ filled form per group. 

2) __Complete the homework!__ To check if the homework was submitted on time, we'll take into account the __last__ commit. Thus __do not__ make any commits after the deadline, unless you need more time to complete the tasks (remember that for delays the policy on [`README.md`] of each homework, will hold). 

__N.b.__: If you need more time to complete the homework, please contact ASAP one of the TAs, declaring it before the deadline. 

#### Individual

For these steps, each one of you is responsible for himself. If at least one of this steps is not performed in __5 days (120 hours)__ after the deadline, we'll not consider your homework as delivered, altough if it exists and it is well done.

3) __Group review__: you need to fill in this form, in which you tell us which was your experience with your team-mates. This is useful for giving the right credits to the ones of you that has worked hard for this homework.

4) __Peer Review__: you need to fill in this form, in which you make the review of a random homework of your colleagues. You can find more details in the [`EVALUATION.md`](https://github.com/CriMenghini/ADM-2018/blob/master/EVALUATION.md) file.


All the required form, will be available in each homework's folder, at the end of the [`README.md`] file.

For any questions regarding the delivery, Slack one of the TAs!

Good luck!
